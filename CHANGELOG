v0.3.1  Moved Templates to Haml -- now requires Radiant 0.6.7 (or 0.6.6 and
        install Haml yourself -- untested).

        Added 'link' value to <r:stylesheet> and <r:javascript> tags so now you
        can create an external link like:

            <r:stylesheet name="my_file.css" as="link" />
            
            or
            
            <r:javascript name="my_file.js" as="link" />
            
        Also made the as="inline" option XHTML compliant by replacing the
        commenting (<!-- -->) with a proper CDATA wrapper.
 
        See the documentation in 'available tags' on the page-edit page for more
        (now more readable).


v0.3    Big new features plus code refactoring and a bug fix.  First, the new
        fetures include:
        
          * Added <r:stylesheet> and <r:javascript> tags for use in pages.  This
            lets you inject your stylesheet or javascript code into your Page 
            much like using a snippet or just render the URL to the referenced
            CSS or JS file (see the readme for more on this).
            
          * Added <r:stylesheet> and <r:javascript> tags for use in other
            Stylesheets or Javascripts.  This lets you maintain mulitple files
            yet just serve one master-stylesheet or master-javascript to your
            end users (cut down on server requests)
            
            Along with this, I did a fancy trick with tracking dependencies so
            that the cache knows when to update (add, edit, or remove a file
            referenced by a <r:stylesheet> or <r:javascript> tag and the
            dependant file's effectively_updated_at time changes to reflect it).
            
          * Added file upload button to the index pages.  Now instead of just
            creating new stylesheets or javascripts, you can upload a file into
            Radiant
        
        The bugfix includes the completion of the one addressed in v0.2.1 by
        adding the form helper to the remove.html.erb template.
            
            
v0.2.2  Bugfix - I added the UserActionObserver behavior and accompanying specs
        to the Stylesheet and Javascript models 

v0.2.1  Bugfix - I corrected the ActionController::InvalidAuthenticityToken that
        comes from my not using the form helpers in my templates.  I also weakly
        spec-ed it.
        
        NOTE: This was only a partial fix.  I corrected the edit.html.erb
        template but not the remove.html.erb one.  See v0.3 for the completely
        fixed version.


v0.2    Initial public release.  Complete rebuild of the extension to work with
        Rails 2.0 and Radiant 0.6.6.  Added *lots* of specs and focused on
        making this thing robust.
        
        Basic functionality included:
        
          * Stores stylesheet and javascript files
          
          * Caches them with their own, improved response cache (improved in
            that it handles this file type better)
            
          * Configuration management utility to allow extension users to adjust
            default settings


v0.1    Private release to John and Sean as a proof-of-concept (initially called
        the Files extension).
