PAUL'S EPISTLES

Book 45	Romans

001:001 Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle,
        separated unto the gospel of God,

001:002 (Which he had promised afore by his prophets in the holy
        scriptures,)

001:003 Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of
        the seed of David according to the flesh;

001:004 And declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the
        spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead:

001:005 By whom we have received grace and apostleship, for obedience
        to the faith among all nations, for his name:

001:006 Among whom are ye also the called of Jesus Christ:

001:007 To all that be in Rome, beloved of God, called to be saints:
        Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus
        Christ.

001:008 First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that
        your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world.

001:009 For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the
        gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you
        always in my prayers;

001:010 Making request, if by any means now at length I might have a
        prosperous journey by the will of God to come unto you.

001:011 For I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some
        spiritual gift, to the end ye may be established;

001:012 That is, that I may be comforted together with you by the
        mutual faith both of you and me.

001:013 Now I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that oftentimes I
        purposed to come unto you, (but was let hitherto,) that I
        might have some fruit among you also, even as among other
        Gentiles.

001:014 I am debtor both to the Greeks, and to the Barbarians; both to
        the wise, and to the unwise.

001:015 So, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to
        you that are at Rome also.

001:016 For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the
        power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to
        the Jew first, and also to the Greek.

001:017 For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to
        faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith.

001:018 For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all
        ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in
        unrighteousness;

001:019 Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them;
        for God hath shewed it unto them.

001:020 For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world
        are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are
        made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are
        without excuse:

001:021 Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as
        God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their
        imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.

001:022 Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,

001:023 And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image
        made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted
        beasts, and creeping things.

001:024 Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the
        lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies
        between themselves:

001:025 Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and
        served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for
        ever. Amen.

001:026 For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even
        their women did change the natural use into that which is
        against nature:

001:027 And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the
        woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men
        working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves
        that recompence of their error which was meet.

001:028 And even as they did not like to retain God in their
        knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those
        things which are not convenient;

001:029 Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication,
        wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder,
        debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers,

001:030 Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters,
        inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,

001:031 Without understanding, covenantbreakers, without natural
        affection, implacable, unmerciful:

001:032 Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such
        things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have
        pleasure in them that do them.

002:001 Therefore thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art that
        judgest: for wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest
        thyself; for thou that judgest doest the same things.

002:002 But we are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth
        against them which commit such things.

002:003 And thinkest thou this, O man, that judgest them which do such
        things, and doest the same, that thou shalt escape the
        judgment of God?

002:004 Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance
        and longsuffering; not knowing that the goodness of God
        leadeth thee to repentance?

002:005 But after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up unto
        thyself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the
        righteous judgment of God;

002:006 Who will render to every man according to his deeds:

002:007 To them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for
        glory and honour and immortality, eternal life:

002:008 But unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth,
        but obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath,

002:009 Tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that doeth
        evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Gentile;

002:010 But glory, honour, and peace, to every man that worketh good,
        to the Jew first, and also to the Gentile:

002:011 For there is no respect of persons with God.

002:012 For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish
        without law: and as many as have sinned in the law shall be
        judged by the law;

002:013 (For not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the
        doers of the law shall be justified.

002:014 For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature
        the things contained in the law, these, having not the law,
        are a law unto themselves:

002:015 Which shew the work of the law written in their hearts, their
        conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts the mean
        while accusing or else excusing one another;)

002:016 In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus
        Christ according to my gospel.

002:017 Behold, thou art called a Jew, and restest in the law, and
        makest thy boast of God,

002:018 And knowest his will, and approvest the things that are more
        excellent, being instructed out of the law;

002:019 And art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind,
        a light of them which are in darkness,

002:020 An instructor of the foolish, a teacher of babes, which hast
        the form of knowledge and of the truth in the law.

002:021 Thou therefore which teachest another, teachest thou not
        thyself? thou that preachest a man should not steal, dost thou
        steal?

002:022 Thou that sayest a man should not commit adultery, dost thou
        commit adultery? thou that abhorrest idols, dost thou commit
        sacrilege?

002:023 Thou that makest thy boast of the law, through breaking the
        law dishonourest thou God?

002:024 For the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles through
        you, as it is written.

002:025 For circumcision verily profiteth, if thou keep the law: but
        if thou be a breaker of the law, thy circumcision is made
        uncircumcision.

002:026 Therefore if the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the
        law, shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision?

002:027 And shall not uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfil
        the law, judge thee, who by the letter and circumcision dost
        transgress the law?

002:028 For he is not a Jew, which is one outwardly; neither is that
        circumcision, which is outward in the flesh:

002:029 But he is a Jew, which is one inwardly; and circumcision is
        that of the heart, in the spirit, and not in the letter; whose
        praise is not of men, but of God.

003:001 What advantage then hath the Jew? or what profit is there of
        circumcision?

003:002 Much every way: chiefly, because that unto them were committed
        the oracles of God.

003:003 For what if some did not believe? shall their unbelief make
        the faith of God without effect?

003:004 God forbid: yea, let God be true, but every man a liar; as it
        is written, That thou mightest be justified in thy sayings,
        and mightest overcome when thou art judged.

003:005 But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God,
        what shall we say? Is God unrighteous who taketh vengeance? (I
        speak as a man)

003:006 God forbid: for then how shall God judge the world?

003:007 For if the truth of God hath more abounded through my lie unto
        his glory; why yet am I also judged as a sinner?

003:008 And not rather, (as we be slanderously reported, and as some
        affirm that we say,) Let us do evil, that good may come? whose
        damnation is just.

003:009 What then? are we better than they? No, in no wise: for we
        have before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all
        under sin;

003:010 As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:

003:011 There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh
        after God.

003:012 They are all gone out of the way, they are together become
        unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.

003:013 Their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they
        have used deceit; the poison of asps is under their lips:

003:014 Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness:

003:015 Their feet are swift to shed blood:

003:016 Destruction and misery are in their ways:

003:017 And the way of peace have they not known:

003:018 There is no fear of God before their eyes.

003:019 Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to
        them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped,
        and all the world may become guilty before God.

003:020 Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be
        justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of
        sin.

003:021 But now the righteousness of God without the law is
        manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets;

003:022 Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus
        Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is
        no difference:

003:023 For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;

003:024 Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption
        that is in Christ Jesus:

003:025 Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in
        his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of
        sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;

003:026 To declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he
        might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in
        Jesus.

003:027 Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works?
        Nay: but by the law of faith.

003:028 Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without
        the deeds of the law.

003:029 Is he the God of the Jews only? is he not also of the
        Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also:

003:030 Seeing it is one God, which shall justify the circumcision by
        faith, and uncircumcision through faith.

003:031 Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea,
        we establish the law.

004:001 What shall we say then that Abraham our father, as pertaining
        to the flesh, hath found?

004:002 For if Abraham were justified by works, he hath whereof to
        glory; but not before God.

004:003 For what saith the scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was
        counted unto him for righteousness.

004:004 Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace,
        but of debt.

004:005 But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that
        justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for
        righteousness.

004:006 Even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man, unto
        whom God imputeth righteousness without works,

004:007 Saying, Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and
        whose sins are covered.

004:008 Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin.

004:009 Cometh this blessedness then upon the circumcision only, or
        upon the uncircumcision also? for we say that faith was
        reckoned to Abraham for righteousness.

004:010 How was it then reckoned? when he was in circumcision, or in
        uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.

004:011 And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the
        righteousness of the faith which he had yet being
        uncircumcised: that he might be the father of all them that
        believe, though they be not circumcised; that righteousness
        might be imputed unto them also:

004:012 And the father of circumcision to them who are not of the
        circumcision only, but who also walk in the steps of that
        faith of our father Abraham, which he had being yet
        uncircumcised.

004:013 For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world, was
        not to Abraham, or to his seed, through the law, but through
        the righteousness of faith.

004:014 For if they which are of the law be heirs, faith is made void,
        and the promise made of none effect:

004:015 Because the law worketh wrath: for where no law is, there is
        no transgression.

004:016 Therefore it is of faith, that it might be by grace; to the
        end the promise might be sure to all the seed; not to that
        only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the
        faith of Abraham; who is the father of us all,

004:017 (As it is written, I have made thee a father of many nations,)
        before him whom he believed, even God, who quickeneth the
        dead, and calleth those things which be not as though they
        were.

004:018 Who against hope believed in hope, that he might become the
        father of many nations, according to that which was spoken, So
        shall thy seed be.

004:019 And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body
        now dead, when he was about an hundred years old, neither yet
        the deadness of Sarah's womb:

004:020 He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but
        was strong in faith, giving glory to God;

004:021 And being fully persuaded that, what he had promised, he was
        able also to perform.

004:022 And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness.

004:023 Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was imputed
        to him;

004:024 But for us also, to whom it shall be imputed, if we believe on
        him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead;

004:025 Who was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for
        our justification.

005:001 Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God
        through our Lord Jesus Christ:

005:002 By whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein
        we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.

005:003 And not only so, but we glory in tribulations also: knowing
        that tribulation worketh patience;

005:004 And patience, experience; and experience, hope:

005:005 And hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed
        abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us.

005:006 For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died
        for the ungodly.

005:007 For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet
        peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die.

005:008 But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were
        yet sinners, Christ died for us.

005:009 Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be
        saved from wrath through him.

005:010 For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the
        death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be
        saved by his life.

005:011 And not only so, but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus
        Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement.

005:012 Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death
        by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have
        sinned:

005:013 (For until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not
        imputed when there is no law.

005:014 Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them
        that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's
        transgression, who is the figure of him that was to come.

005:015 But not as the offence, so also is the free gift. For if
        through the offence of one many be dead, much more the grace
        of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man, Jesus
        Christ, hath abounded unto many.

005:016 And not as it was by one that sinned, so is the gift: for the
        judgment was by one to condemnation, but the free gift is of
        many offences unto justification.

005:017 For if by one man's offence death reigned by one; much more
        they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of
        righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.)

005:018 Therefore as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men
        to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one the free
        gift came upon all men unto justification of life.

005:019 For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by
        the obedience of one shall many be made righteous.

005:020 Moreover the law entered, that the offence might abound. But
        where sin abounded, grace did much more abound:

005:021 That as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign
        through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our
        Lord.

006:001 What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace
        may abound?

006:002 God forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any
        longer therein?

006:003 Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus
        Christ were baptized into his death?

006:004 Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that
        like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the
        Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.

006:005 For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his
        death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection:

006:006 Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the
        body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not
        serve sin.

006:007 For he that is dead is freed from sin.

006:008 Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also
        live with him:

006:009 Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more;
        death hath no more dominion over him.

006:010 For in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he
        liveth, he liveth unto God.

006:011 Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin,
        but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord.

006:012 Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye
        should obey it in the lusts thereof.

006:013 Neither yield ye your members as instruments of
        unrighteousness unto sin: but yield yourselves unto God, as
        those that are alive from the dead, and your members as
        instruments of righteousness unto God.

006:014 For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under
        the law, but under grace.

006:015 What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but
        under grace? God forbid.

006:016 Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to
        obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto
        death, or of obedience unto righteousness?

006:017 But God be thanked, that ye were the servants of sin, but ye
        have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was
        delivered you.

006:018 Being then made free from sin, ye became the servants of
        righteousness.

006:019 I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of
        your flesh: for as ye have yielded your members servants to
        uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity; even so now yield
        your members servants to righteousness unto holiness.

006:020 For when ye were the servants of sin, ye were free from
        righteousness.

006:021 What fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now
        ashamed? for the end of those things is death.

006:022 But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God,
        ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting
        life.

006:023 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal
        life through Jesus Christ our Lord.

007:001 Know ye not, brethren, (for I speak to them that know the
        law,) how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he
        liveth?

007:002 For the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her
        husband so long as he liveth; but if the husband be dead, she
        is loosed from the law of her husband.

007:003 So then if, while her husband liveth, she be married to
        another man, she shall be called an adulteress: but if her
        husband be dead, she is free from that law; so that she is no
        adulteress, though she be married to another man.

007:004 Wherefore, my brethren, ye also are become dead to the law by
        the body of Christ; that ye should be married to another, even
        to him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth
        fruit unto God.

007:005 For when we were in the flesh, the motions of sins, which were
        by the law, did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto
        death.

007:006 But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein
        we were held; that we should serve in newness of spirit, and
        not in the oldness of the letter.

007:007 What shall we say then? Is the law sin? God forbid. Nay, I had
        not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust,
        except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet.

007:008 But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all
        manner of concupiscence. For without the law sin was dead.

007:009 For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment
        came, sin revived, and I died.

007:010 And the commandment, which was ordained to life, I found to be
        unto death.

007:011 For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and
        by it slew me.

007:012 Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just,
        and good.

007:013 Was then that which is good made death unto me? God forbid.
        But sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that
        which is good; that sin by the commandment might become
        exceeding sinful.

007:014 For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold
        under sin.

007:015 For that which I do I allow not: for what I would, that do I
        not; but what I hate, that do I.

007:016 If then I do that which I would not, I consent unto the law
        that it is good.

007:017 Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in
        me.

007:018 For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good
        thing: for to will is present with me; but how to perform that
        which is good I find not.

007:019 For the good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would
        not, that I do.

007:020 Now if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but
        sin that dwelleth in me.

007:021 I find then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is present
        with me.

007:022 For I delight in the law of God after the inward man:

007:023 But I see another law in my members, warring against the law
        of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin
        which is in my members.

007:024 O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body
        of this death?

007:025 I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then with the
        mind I myself serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law
        of sin.

008:001 There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in
        Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the
        Spirit.

008:002 For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me
        free from the law of sin and death.

008:003 For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the
        flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful
        flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh:

008:004 That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us,
        who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.

008:005 For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the
        flesh; but they that are after the Spirit the things of the
        Spirit.

008:006 For to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually
        minded is life and peace.

008:007 Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not
        subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.

008:008 So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God.

008:009 But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that
        the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the
        Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.

008:010 And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin; but
        the Spirit is life because of righteousness.

008:011 But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead
        dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall
        also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in
        you.

008:012 Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live
        after the flesh.

008:013 For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye
        through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall
        live.

008:014 For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons
        of God.

008:015 For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear;
        but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry,
        Abba, Father.

008:016 The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are
        the children of God:

008:017 And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs
        with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be
        also glorified together.

008:018 For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not
        worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed
        in us.

008:019 For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the
        manifestation of the sons of God.

008:020 For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly,
        but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope,

008:021 Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the
        bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the
        children of God.

008:022 For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in
        pain together until now.

008:023 And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the
        firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within
        ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of
        our body.

008:024 For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope:
        for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for?

008:025 But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience
        wait for it.

008:026 Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know
        not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself
        maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be
        uttered.

008:027 And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of
        the Spirit, because he maketh intercession for the saints
        according to the will of God.

008:028 And we know that all things work together for good to them
        that love God, to them who are the called according to his
        purpose.

008:029 For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be
        conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the
        firstborn among many brethren.

008:030 Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and
        whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified,
        them he also glorified.

008:031 What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who
        can be against us?

008:032 He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us
        all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?

008:033 Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect? It is
        God that justifieth.

008:034 Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea rather,
        that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who
        also maketh intercession for us.

008:035 Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall
        tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or
        nakedness, or peril, or sword?

008:036 As it is written, For thy sake we are killed all the day long;
        we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.

008:037 Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through
        him that loved us.

008:038 For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels,
        nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things
        to come,

008:039 Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able
        to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus
        our Lord.

009:001 I say the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience also
        bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost,

009:002 That I have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart.

009:003 For I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ for my
        brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh:

009:004 Who are Israelites; to whom pertaineth the adoption, and the
        glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the
        service of God, and the promises;

009:005 Whose are the fathers, and of whom as concerning the flesh
        Christ came, who is over all, God blessed for ever. Amen.

009:006 Not as though the word of God hath taken none effect. For they
        are not all Israel, which are of Israel:

009:007 Neither, because they are the seed of Abraham, are they all
        children: but, In Isaac shall thy seed be called.

009:008 That is, They which are the children of the flesh, these are
        not the children of God: but the children of the promise are
        counted for the seed.

009:009 For this is the word of promise, At this time will I come, and
        Sarah shall have a son.

009:010 And not only this; but when Rebecca also had conceived by one,
        even by our father Isaac;

009:011 (For the children being not yet born, neither having done any
        good or evil, that the purpose of God according to election
        might stand, not of works, but of him that calleth;)

009:012 It was said unto her, The elder shall serve the younger.

009:013 As it is written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated.

009:014 What shall we say then? Is there unrighteousness with God? God
        forbid.

009:015 For he saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have
        mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have
        compassion.

009:016 So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that
        runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy.

009:017 For the scripture saith unto Pharaoh, Even for this same
        purpose have I raised thee up, that I might shew my power in
        thee, and that my name might be declared throughout all the
        earth.

009:018 Therefore hath he mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom
        he will he hardeneth.

009:019 Thou wilt say then unto me, Why doth he yet find fault? For
        who hath resisted his will?

009:020 Nay but, O man, who art thou that repliest against God? Shall
        the thing formed say to him that formed it, Why hast thou made
        me thus?

009:021 Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to
        make one vessel unto honour, and another unto dishonour?

009:022 What if God, willing to shew his wrath, and to make his power
        known, endured with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath
        fitted to destruction:

009:023 And that he might make known the riches of his glory on the
        vessels of mercy, which he had afore prepared unto glory,

009:024 Even us, whom he hath called, not of the Jews only, but also
        of the Gentiles?

009:025 As he saith also in Osee, I will call them my people, which
        were not my people; and her beloved, which was not beloved.

009:026 And it shall come to pass, that in the place where it was said
        unto them, Ye are not my people; there shall they be called
        the children of the living God.

009:027 Esaias also crieth concerning Israel, Though the number of the
        children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, a remnant shall
        be saved:

009:028 For he will finish the work, and cut it short in
        righteousness: because a short work will the Lord make upon
        the earth.

009:029 And as Esaias said before, Except the Lord of Sabaoth had left
        us a seed, we had been as Sodoma, and been made like unto
        Gomorrha.

009:030 What shall we say then? That the Gentiles, which followed not
        after righteousness, have attained to righteousness, even the
        righteousness which is of faith.

009:031 But Israel, which followed after the law of righteousness,
        hath not attained to the law of righteousness.

009:032 Wherefore? Because they sought it not by faith, but as it were
        by the works of the law. For they stumbled at that
        stumblingstone;

009:033 As it is written, Behold, I lay in Sion a stumblingstone and
        rock of offence: and whosoever believeth on him shall not be
        ashamed.

010:001 Brethren, my heart's desire and prayer to God for Israel is,
        that they might be saved.

010:002 For I bear them record that they have a zeal of God, but not
        according to knowledge.

010:003 For they being ignorant of God's righteousness, and going
        about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted
        themselves unto the righteousness of God.

010:004 For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every
        one that believeth.

010:005 For Moses describeth the righteousness which is of the law,
        That the man which doeth those things shall live by them.

010:006 But the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise,
        Say not in thine heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? (that
        is, to bring Christ down from above:)

010:007 Or, Who shall descend into the deep? (that is, to bring up
        Christ again from the dead.)

010:008 But what saith it? The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth,
        and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach;

010:009 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and
        shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the
        dead, thou shalt be saved.

010:010 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with
        the mouth confession is made unto salvation.

010:011 For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not
        be ashamed.

010:012 For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for
        the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him.

010:013 For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be
        saved.

010:014 How then shall they call on him in whom they have not
        believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have
        not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher?

010:015 And how shall they preach, except they be sent? as it is
        written, How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the
        gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things!

010:016 But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Esaias saith,
        Lord, who hath believed our report?

010:017 So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of
        God.

010:018 But I say, Have they not heard? Yes verily, their sound went
        into all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the
        world.

010:019 But I say, Did not Israel know? First Moses saith, I will
        provoke you to jealousy by them that are no people, and by a
        foolish nation I will anger you.

010:020 But Esaias is very bold, and saith, I was found of them that
        sought me not; I was made manifest unto them that asked not
        after me.

010:021 But to Israel he saith, All day long I have stretched forth my
        hands unto a disobedient and gainsaying people.

011:001 I say then, Hath God cast away his people? God forbid. For I
        also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of
        Benjamin.

011:002 God hath not cast away his people which he foreknew. Wot ye
        not what the scripture saith of Elias? how he maketh
        intercession to God against Israel saying,

011:003 Lord, they have killed thy prophets, and digged down thine
        altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life.

011:004 But what saith the answer of God unto him? I have reserved to
        myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to the
        image of Baal.

011:005 Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant
        according to the election of grace.

011:006 And if by grace, then is it no more of works: otherwise grace
        is no more grace. But if it be of works, then it is no more
        grace: otherwise work is no more work.

011:007 What then? Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for;
        but the election hath obtained it, and the rest were blinded.

011:008 (According as it is written, God hath given them the spirit of
        slumber, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they
        should not hear;) unto this day.

011:009 And David saith, Let their table be made a snare, and a trap,
        and a stumblingblock, and a recompence unto them:

011:010 Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see, and bow
        down their back alway.

011:011 I say then, Have they stumbled that they should fall? God
        forbid: but rather through their fall salvation is come unto
        the Gentiles, for to provoke them to jealousy.

011:012 Now if the fall of them be the riches of the world, and the
        diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles; how much more
        their fulness?

011:013 For I speak to you Gentiles, inasmuch as I am the apostle of
        the Gentiles, I magnify mine office:

011:014 If by any means I may provoke to emulation them which are my
        flesh, and might save some of them.

011:015 For if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the
        world, what shall the receiving of them be, but life from the
        dead?

011:016 For if the firstfruit be holy, the lump is also holy: and if
        the root be holy, so are the branches.

011:017 And if some of the branches be broken off, and thou, being a
        wild olive tree, wert graffed in among them, and with them
        partakest of the root and fatness of the olive tree;

011:018 Boast not against the branches. But if thou boast, thou
        bearest not the root, but the root thee.

011:019 Thou wilt say then, The branches were broken off, that I might
        be graffed in.

011:020 Well; because of unbelief they were broken off, and thou
        standest by faith. Be not highminded, but fear:

011:021 For if God spared not the natural branches, take heed lest he
        also spare not thee.

011:022 Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God: on them
        which fell, severity; but toward thee, goodness, if thou
        continue in his goodness: otherwise thou also shalt be cut
        off.

011:023 And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be
        graffed in: for God is able to graff them in again.

011:024 For if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by
        nature, and wert graffed contrary to nature into a good olive
        tree: how much more shall these, which be the natural
        branches, be graffed into their own olive tree?

011:025 For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this
        mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own conceits; that
        blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fulness of
        the Gentiles be come in.

011:026 And so all Israel shall be saved: as it is written, There
        shall come out of Sion the Deliverer, and shall turn away
        ungodliness from Jacob:

011:027 For this is my covenant unto them, when I shall take away
        their sins.

011:028 As concerning the gospel, they are enemies for your sakes: but
        as touching the election, they are beloved for the father's
        sakes.

011:029 For the gifts and calling of God are without repentance.

011:030 For as ye in times past have not believed God, yet have now
        obtained mercy through their unbelief:

011:031 Even so have these also now not believed, that through your
        mercy they also may obtain mercy.

011:032 For God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that he might
        have mercy upon all.

011:033 O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of
        God! how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past
        finding out!

011:034 For who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been his
        counsellor?

011:035 Or who hath first given to him, and it shall be recompensed
        unto him again?

011:036 For of him, and through him, and to him, are all things: to
        whom be glory for ever. Amen.

012:001 I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that
        ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable
        unto God, which is your reasonable service.

012:002 And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by
        the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that
        good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.

012:003 For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that
        is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he
        ought to think; but to think soberly, according as God hath
        dealt to every man the measure of faith.

012:004 For as we have many members in one body, and all members have
        not the same office:

012:005 So we, being many, are one body in Christ, and every one
        members one of another.

012:006 Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is
        given to us, whether prophecy, let us prophesy according to
        the proportion of faith;

012:007 Or ministry, let us wait on our ministering: or he that
        teacheth, on teaching;

012:008 Or he that exhorteth, on exhortation: he that giveth, let him
        do it with simplicity; he that ruleth, with diligence; he that
        sheweth mercy, with cheerfulness.

012:009 Let love be without dissimulation. Abhor that which is evil;
        cleave to that which is good.

012:010 Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love; in
        honour preferring one another;

012:011 Not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord;

012:012 Rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; continuing instant
        in prayer;

012:013 Distributing to the necessity of saints; given to hospitality.

012:014 Bless them which persecute you: bless, and curse not.

012:015 Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that
        weep.

012:016 Be of the same mind one toward another. Mind not high things,
        but condescend to men of low estate. Be not wise in your own
        conceits.

012:017 Recompense to no man evil for evil. Provide things honest in
        the sight of all men.

012:018 If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably
        with all men.

012:019 Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place
        unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will
        repay, saith the Lord.

012:020 Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give
        him drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on
        his head.

012:021 Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.

013:001 Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is
        no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God.

013:002 Whosoever therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the
        ordinance of God: and they that resist shall receive to
        themselves damnation.

013:003 For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil.
        Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? do that which is
        good, and thou shalt have praise of the same:

013:004 For he is the minister of God to thee for good. But if thou do
        that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in
        vain: for he is the minister of God, a revenger to execute
        wrath upon him that doeth evil.

013:005 Wherefore ye must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but
        also for conscience sake.

013:006 For for this cause pay ye tribute also: for they are God's
        ministers, attending continually upon this very thing.

013:007 Render therefore to all their dues: tribute to whom tribute is
        due; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honour to whom
        honour.

013:008 Owe no man any thing, but to love one another: for he that
        loveth another hath fulfilled the law.

013:009 For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill,
        Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Thou
        shalt not covet; and if there be any other commandment, it is
        briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, Thou shalt love
        thy neighbour as thyself.

013:010 Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore love is the
        fulfilling of the law.

013:011 And that, knowing the time, that now it is high time to awake
        out of sleep: for now is our salvation nearer than when we
        believed.

013:012 The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore
        cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour
        of light.

013:013 Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in rioting and
        drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife
        and envying.

013:014 But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision
        for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof.

014:001 Him that is weak in the faith receive ye, but not to doubtful
        disputations.

014:002 For one believeth that he may eat all things: another, who is
        weak, eateth herbs.

014:003 Let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not; and let
        not him which eateth not judge him that eateth: for God hath
        received him.

014:004 Who art thou that judgest another man's servant? to his own
        master he standeth or falleth. Yea, he shall be holden up: for
        God is able to make him stand.

014:005 One man esteemeth one day above another: another esteemeth
        every day alike. Let every man be fully persuaded in his own
        mind.

014:006 He that regardeth the day, regardeth it unto the Lord; and he
        that regardeth not the day, to the Lord he doth not regard it.
        He that eateth, eateth to the Lord, for he giveth God thanks;
        and he that eateth not, to the Lord he eateth not, and giveth
        God thanks.

014:007 For none of us liveth to himself, and no man dieth to himself.

014:008 For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; and whether we
        die, we die unto the Lord: whether we live therefore, or die,
        we are the Lord's.

014:009 For to this end Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that
        he might be Lord both of the dead and living.

014:010 But why dost thou judge thy brother? or why dost thou set at
        nought thy brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment
        seat of Christ.

014:011 For it is written, As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall
        bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God.

014:012 So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God.

014:013 Let us not therefore judge one another any more: but judge
        this rather, that no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion
        to fall in his brother's way.

014:014 I know, and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus, that there is
        nothing unclean of itself: but to him that esteemeth any thing
        to be unclean, to him it is unclean.

014:015 But if thy brother be grieved with thy meat, now walkest thou
        not charitably. Destroy not him with thy meat, for whom Christ
        died.

014:016 Let not then your good be evil spoken of:

014:017 For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but
        righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.

014:018 For he that in these things serveth Christ is acceptable to
        God, and approved of men.

014:019 Let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace,
        and things wherewith one may edify another.

014:020 For meat destroy not the work of God. All things indeed are
        pure; but it is evil for that man who eateth with offence.

014:021 It is good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor any
        thing whereby thy brother stumbleth, or is offended, or is
        made weak.

014:022 Hast thou faith? have it to thyself before God. Happy is he
        that condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth.

014:023 And he that doubteth is damned if he eat, because he eateth
        not of faith: for whatsoever is not of faith is sin.

015:001 We then that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the
        weak, and not to please ourselves.

015:002 Let every one of us please his neighbour for his good to
        edification.

015:003 For even Christ pleased not himself; but, as it is written,
        The reproaches of them that reproached thee fell on me.

015:004 For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for
        our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the
        scriptures might have hope.

015:005 Now the God of patience and consolation grant you to be
        likeminded one toward another according to Christ Jesus:

015:006 That ye may with one mind and one mouth glorify God, even the
        Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.

015:007 Wherefore receive ye one another, as Christ also received us
        to the glory of God.

015:008 Now I say that Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision
        for the truth of God, to confirm the promises made unto the
        fathers:

015:009 And that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy; as it
        is written, For this cause I will confess to thee among the
        Gentiles, and sing unto thy name.

015:010 And again he saith, Rejoice, ye Gentiles, with his people.

015:011 And again, Praise the Lord, all ye Gentiles; and laud him, all
        ye people.

015:012 And again, Esaias saith, There shall be a root of Jesse, and
        he that shall rise to reign over the Gentiles; in him shall
        the Gentiles trust.

015:013 Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in
        believing, that ye may abound in hope, through the power of
        the Holy Ghost.

015:014 And I myself also am persuaded of you, my brethren, that ye
        also are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able
        also to admonish one another.

015:015 Nevertheless, brethren, I have written the more boldly unto
        you in some sort, as putting you in mind, because of the grace
        that is given to me of God,

015:016 That I should be the minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles,
        ministering the gospel of God, that the offering up of the
        Gentiles might be acceptable, being sanctified by the Holy
        Ghost.

015:017 I have therefore whereof I may glory through Jesus Christ in
        those things which pertain to God.

015:018 For I will not dare to speak of any of those things which
        Christ hath not wrought by me, to make the Gentiles obedient,
        by word and deed,

015:019 Through mighty signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit
        of God; so that from Jerusalem, and round about unto
        Illyricum, I have fully preached the gospel of Christ.

015:020 Yea, so have I strived to preach the gospel, not where Christ
        was named, lest I should build upon another man's foundation:

015:021 But as it is written, To whom he was not spoken of, they shall
        see: and they that have not heard shall understand.

015:022 For which cause also I have been much hindered from coming to
        you.

015:023 But now having no more place in these parts, and having a
        great desire these many years to come unto you;

015:024 Whensoever I take my journey into Spain, I will come to you:
        for I trust to see you in my journey, and to be brought on my
        way thitherward by you, if first I be somewhat filled with
        your company.

015:025 But now I go unto Jerusalem to minister unto the saints.

015:026 For it hath pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a
        certain contribution for the poor saints which are at
        Jerusalem.

015:027 It hath pleased them verily; and their debtors they are. For
        if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual
        things, their duty is also to minister unto them in carnal
        things.

015:028 When therefore I have performed this, and have sealed to them
        this fruit, I will come by you into Spain.

015:029 And I am sure that, when I come unto you, I shall come in the
        fulness of the blessing of the gospel of Christ.

015:030 Now I beseech you, brethren, for the Lord Jesus Christ's sake,
        and for the love of the Spirit, that ye strive together with
        me in your prayers to God for me;

015:031 That I may be delivered from them that do not believe in
        Judaea; and that my service which I have for Jerusalem may be
        accepted of the saints;

015:032 That I may come unto you with joy by the will of God, and may
        with you be refreshed.

015:033 Now the God of peace be with you all. Amen.

016:001 I commend unto you Phebe our sister, which is a servant of the
        church which is at Cenchrea:

016:002 That ye receive her in the Lord, as becometh saints, and that
        ye assist her in whatsoever business she hath need of you: for
        she hath been a succourer of many, and of myself also.

016:003 Greet Priscilla and Aquila my helpers in Christ Jesus:

016:004 Who have for my life laid down their own necks: unto whom not
        only I give thanks, but also all the churches of the Gentiles.

016:005 Likewise greet the church that is in their house. Salute my
        well-beloved Epaenetus, who is the firstfruits of Achaia unto
        Christ.

016:006 Greet Mary, who bestowed much labour on us.

016:007 Salute Andronicus and Junia, my kinsmen, and my
        fellow-prisoners, who are of note among the apostles, who also
        were in Christ before me.

016:008 Greet Amplias my beloved in the Lord.

016:009 Salute Urbane, our helper in Christ, and Stachys my beloved.

016:010 Salute Apelles approved in Christ. Salute them which are of
        Aristobulus' household.

016:011 Salute Herodion my kinsman. Greet them that be of the
        household of Narcissus, which are in the Lord.

016:012 Salute Tryphena and Tryphosa, who labour in the Lord. Salute
        the beloved Persis, which laboured much in the Lord.

016:013 Salute Rufus chosen in the Lord, and his mother and mine.

016:014 Salute Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermas, Patrobas, Hermes, and the
        brethren which are with them.

016:015 Salute Philologus, and Julia, Nereus, and his sister, and
        Olympas, and all the saints which are with them.

016:016 Salute one another with an holy kiss. The churches of Christ
        salute you.

016:017 Now I beseech you, brethren, mark them which cause divisions
        and offences contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned;
        and avoid them.

016:018 For they that are such serve not our Lord Jesus Christ, but
        their own belly; and by good words and fair speeches deceive
        the hearts of the simple.

016:019 For your obedience is come abroad unto all men. I am glad
        therefore on your behalf: but yet I would have you wise unto
        that which is good, and simple concerning evil.

016:020 And the God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet
        shortly. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.

016:021 Timotheus my workfellow, and Lucius, and Jason, and Sosipater,
        my kinsmen, salute you.

016:022 I Tertius, who wrote this epistle, salute you in the Lord.

016:023 Gaius mine host, and of the whole church, saluteth you.
        Erastus the chamberlain of the city saluteth you, and Quartus
        a brother.

016:024 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.

016:025 Now to him that is of power to stablish you according to my
        gospel, and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the
        revelation of the mystery, which was kept secret since the
        world began,

016:026 But now is made manifest, and by the scriptures of the
        prophets, according to the commandment of the everlasting God,
        made known to all nations for the obedience of faith:

016:027 To God only wise, be glory through Jesus Christ for ever.
        Amen.

Book 46	1 Corinthians

001:001 Paul called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will
        of God, and Sosthenes our brother,

001:002 Unto the church of God which is at Corinth, to them that are
        sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints, with all that
        in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord,
        both their's and our's:

001:003 Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and from
        the Lord Jesus Christ.

001:004 I thank my God always on your behalf, for the grace of God
        which is given you by Jesus Christ;

001:005 That in every thing ye are enriched by him, in all utterance,
        and in all knowledge;

001:006 Even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you:

001:007 So that ye come behind in no gift; waiting for the coming of
        our Lord Jesus Christ:

001:008 Who shall also confirm you unto the end, that ye may be
        blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.

001:009 God is faithful, by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of
        his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.

001:010 Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus
        Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and that there be no
        divisions among you; but that ye be perfectly joined together
        in the same mind and in the same judgment.

001:011 For it hath been declared unto me of you, my brethren, by them
        which are of the house of Chloe, that there are contentions
        among you.

001:012 Now this I say, that every one of you saith, I am of Paul; and
        I of Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ.

001:013 Is Christ divided? was Paul crucified for you? or were ye
        baptized in the name of Paul?

001:014 I thank God that I baptized none of you, but Crispus and
        Gaius;

001:015 Lest any should say that I had baptized in mine own name.

001:016 And I baptized also the household of Stephanas: besides, I
        know not whether I baptized any other.

001:017 For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel:
        not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be
        made of none effect.

001:018 For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish
        foolishness; but unto us which are saved it is the power of
        God.

001:019 For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and
        will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent.

001:020 Where is the wise? where is the scribe? where is the disputer
        of this world? hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this
        world?

001:021 For after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew
        not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to
        save them that believe.

001:022 For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom:

001:023 But we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a
        stumblingblock, and unto the Greeks foolishness;

001:024 But unto them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ
        the power of God, and the wisdom of God.

001:025 Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the
        weakness of God is stronger than men.

001:026 For ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men
        after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called:

001:027 But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to
        confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the
        world to confound the things which are mighty;

001:028 And base things of the world, and things which are despised,
        hath God chosen, yea, and things which are not, to bring to
        nought things that are:

001:029 That no flesh should glory in his presence.

001:030 But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us
        wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption:

001:031 That, according as it is written, He that glorieth, let him
        glory in the Lord.

002:001 And I, brethren, when I came to you, came not with excellency
        of speech or of wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony of
        God.

002:002 For I determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus
        Christ, and him crucified.

002:003 And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much
        trembling.

002:004 And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of
        man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power:

002:005 That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in
        the power of God.

002:006 Howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: yet not
        the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world,
        that come to nought:

002:007 But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden
        wisdom, which God ordained before the world unto our glory:

002:008 Which none of the princes of this world knew: for had they
        known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.

002:009 But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard,
        neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which
        God hath prepared for them that love him.

002:010 But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit: for the
        Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.

002:011 For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of
        man which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man,
        but the Spirit of God.

002:012 Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the
        spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are
        freely given to us of God.

002:013 Which things also we speak, not in the words which man's
        wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing
        spiritual things with spiritual.

002:014 But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of
        God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know
        them, because they are spiritually discerned.

002:015 But he that is spiritual judgeth all things, yet he himself is
        judged of no man.

002:016 For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct
        him? But we have the mind of Christ.

003:001 And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual,
        but as unto carnal, even as unto babes in Christ.

003:002 I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for hitherto ye
        were not able to bear it, neither yet now are ye able.

003:003 For ye are yet carnal: for whereas there is among you envying,
        and strife, and divisions, are ye not carnal, and walk as men?

003:004 For while one saith, I am of Paul; and another, I am of
        Apollos; are ye not carnal?

003:005 Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos, but ministers by whom ye
        believed, even as the Lord gave to every man?

003:006 I have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase.

003:007 So then neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that
        watereth; but God that giveth the increase.

003:008 Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one: and every
        man shall receive his own reward according to his own labour.

003:009 For we are labourers together with God: ye are God's
        husbandry, ye are God's building.

003:010 According to the grace of God which is given unto me, as a
        wise masterbuilder, I have laid the foundation, and another
        buildeth thereon. But let every man take heed how he buildeth
        thereupon.

003:011 For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which
        is Jesus Christ.

003:012 Now if any man build upon this foundation gold, silver,
        precious stones, wood, hay, stubble;

003:013 Every man's work shall be made manifest: for the day shall
        declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire
        shall try every man's work of what sort it is.

003:014 If any man's work abide which he hath built thereupon, he
        shall receive a reward.

003:015 If any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but
        he himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire.

003:016 Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit
        of God dwelleth in you?

003:017 If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy;
        for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are.

003:018 Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seemeth to be
        wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be
        wise.

003:019 For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it
        is written, He taketh the wise in their own craftiness.

003:020 And again, The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that
        they are vain.

003:021 Therefore let no man glory in men. For all things are your's;

003:022 Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or
        death, or things present, or things to come; all are your's;

003:023 And ye are Christ's; and Christ is God's.

004:001 Let a man so account of us, as of the ministers of Christ, and
        stewards of the mysteries of God.

004:002 Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found
        faithful.

004:003 But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged
        of you, or of man's judgment: yea, I judge not mine own self.

004:004 For I know nothing by myself; yet am I not hereby justified:
        but he that judgeth me is the Lord.

004:005 Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come,
        who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness,
        and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts: and then
        shall every man have praise of God.

004:006 And these things, brethren, I have in a figure transferred to
        myself and to Apollos for your sakes; that ye might learn in
        us not to think of men above that which is written, that no
        one of you be puffed up for one against another.

004:007 For who maketh thee to differ from another? and what hast thou
        that thou didst not receive? now if thou didst receive it, why
        dost thou glory, as if thou hadst not received it?

004:008 Now ye are full, now ye are rich, ye have reigned as kings
        without us: and I would to God ye did reign, that we also
        might reign with you.

004:009 For I think that God hath set forth us the apostles last, as
        it were appointed to death: for we are made a spectacle unto
        the world, and to angels, and to men.

004:010 We are fools for Christ's sake, but ye are wise in Christ; we
        are weak, but ye are strong; ye are honourable, but we are
        despised.

004:011 Even unto this present hour we both hunger, and thirst, and
        are naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain
        dwellingplace;

004:012 And labour, working with our own hands: being reviled, we
        bless; being persecuted, we suffer it:

004:013 Being defamed, we intreat: we are made as the filth of the
        world, and are the offscouring of all things unto this day.

004:014 I write not these things to shame you, but as my beloved sons
        I warn you.

004:015 For though ye have ten thousand instructers in Christ, yet
        have ye not many fathers: for in Christ Jesus I have begotten
        you through the gospel.

004:016 Wherefore I beseech you, be ye followers of me.

004:017 For this cause have I sent unto you Timotheus, who is my
        beloved son, and faithful in the Lord, who shall bring you
        into remembrance of my ways which be in Christ, as I teach
        every where in every church.

004:018 Now some are puffed up, as though I would not come to you.

004:019 But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord will, and will
        know, not the speech of them which are puffed up, but the
        power.

004:020 For the kingdom of God is not in word, but in power.

004:021 What will ye? shall I come unto you with a rod, or in love,
        and in the spirit of meekness?

005:001 It is reported commonly that there is fornication among you,
        and such fornication as is not so much as named among the
        Gentiles, that one should have his father's wife.

005:002 And ye are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he
        that hath done this deed might be taken away from among you.

005:003 For I verily, as absent in body, but present in spirit, have
        judged already, as though I were present, concerning him that
        hath so done this deed,

005:004 In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when ye are gathered
        together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus
        Christ,

005:005 To deliver such an one unto Satan for the destruction of the
        flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord
        Jesus.

005:006 Your glorying is not good. Know ye not that a little leaven
        leaveneth the whole lump?

005:007 Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump,
        as ye are unleavened. For even Christ our passover is
        sacrificed for us:

005:008 Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither
        with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the
        unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.

005:009 I wrote unto you in an epistle not to company with
        fornicators:

005:010 Yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with
        the covetous, or extortioners, or with idolaters; for then
        must ye needs go out of the world.

005:011 But now I have written unto you not to keep company, if any
        man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or
        an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner;
        with such an one no not to eat.

005:012 For what have I to do to judge them also that are without? do
        not ye judge them that are within?

005:013 But them that are without God judgeth. Therefore put away from
        among yourselves that wicked person.

006:001 Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to law
        before the unjust, and not before the saints?

006:002 Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world? and if
        the world shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the
        smallest matters?

006:003 Know ye not that we shall judge angels? how much more things
        that pertain to this life?

006:004 If then ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life,
        set them to judge who are least esteemed in the church.

006:005 I speak to your shame. Is it so, that there is not a wise man
        among you? no, not one that shall be able to judge between his
        brethren?

006:006 But brother goeth to law with brother, and that before the
        unbelievers.

006:007 Now therefore there is utterly a fault among you, because ye
        go to law one with another. Why do ye not rather take wrong?
        why do ye not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded?

006:008 Nay, ye do wrong, and defraud, and that your brethren.

006:009 Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom
        of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters,
        nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with
        mankind,

006:010 Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor
        extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.

006:011 And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are
        sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord
        Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.

006:012 All things are lawful unto me, but all things are not
        expedient: all things are lawful for me, but I will not be
        brought under the power of any.

006:013 Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God shall
        destroy both it and them. Now the body is not for fornication,
        but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body.

006:014 And God hath both raised up the Lord, and will also raise up
        us by his own power.

006:015 Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ? shall
        I then take the members of Christ, and make them the members
        of an harlot? God forbid.

006:016 What? know ye not that he which is joined to an harlot is one
        body? for two, saith he, shall be one flesh.

006:017 But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.

006:018 Flee fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is without the
        body; but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his
        own body.

006:019 What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy
        Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not
        your own?

006:020 For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your
        body, and in your spirit, which are God's.

007:001 Now concerning the things whereof ye wrote unto me: It is good
        for a man not to touch a woman.

007:002 Nevertheless, to avoid fornication, let every man have his own
        wife, and let every woman have her own husband.

007:003 Let the husband render unto the wife due benevolence: and
        likewise also the wife unto the husband.

007:004 The wife hath not power of her own body, but the husband: and
        likewise also the husband hath not power of his own body, but
        the wife.

007:005 Defraud ye not one the other, except it be with consent for a
        time, that ye may give yourselves to fasting and prayer; and
        come together again, that Satan tempt you not for your
        incontinency.

007:006 But I speak this by permission, and not of commandment.

007:007 For I would that all men were even as I myself. But every man
        hath his proper gift of God, one after this manner, and
        another after that.

007:008 I say therefore to the unmarried and widows, It is good for
        them if they abide even as I.

007:009 But if they cannot contain, let them marry: for it is better
        to marry than to burn.

007:010 And unto the married I command, yet not I, but the Lord, Let
        not the wife depart from her husband:

007:011 But and if she depart, let her remain unmarried or be
        reconciled to her husband: and let not the husband put away
        his wife.

007:012 But to the rest speak I, not the Lord: If any brother hath a
        wife that believeth not, and she be pleased to dwell with him,
        let him not put her away.

007:013 And the woman which hath an husband that believeth not, and if
        he be pleased to dwell with her, let her not leave him.

007:014 For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the
        unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband: else were your
        children unclean; but now are they holy.

007:015 But if the unbelieving depart, let him depart. A brother or a
        sister is not under bondage in such cases: but God hath called
        us to peace.

007:016 For what knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save thy
        husband? or how knowest thou, O man, whether thou shalt save
        thy wife?

007:017 But as God hath distributed to every man, as the Lord hath
        called every one, so let him walk. And so ordain I in all
        churches.

007:018 Is any man called being circumcised? let him not become
        uncircumcised. Is any called in uncircumcision? let him not be
        circumcised.

007:019 Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but
        the keeping of the commandments of God.

007:020 Let every man abide in the same calling wherein he was called.

007:021 Art thou called being a servant? care not for it: but if thou
        mayest be made free, use it rather.

007:022 For he that is called in the Lord, being a servant, is the
        Lord's freeman: likewise also he that is called, being free,
        is Christ's servant.

007:023 Ye are bought with a price; be not ye the servants of men.

007:024 Brethren, let every man, wherein he is called, therein abide
        with God.

007:025 Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord: yet
        I give my judgment, as one that hath obtained mercy of the
        Lord to be faithful.

007:026 I suppose therefore that this is good for the present
        distress, I say, that it is good for a man so to be.

007:027 Art thou bound unto a wife? seek not to be loosed. Art thou
        loosed from a wife? seek not a wife.

007:028 But and if thou marry, thou hast not sinned; and if a virgin
        marry, she hath not sinned. Nevertheless such shall have
        trouble in the flesh: but I spare you.

007:029 But this I say, brethren, the time is short: it remaineth,
        that both they that have wives be as though they had none;

007:030 And they that weep, as though they wept not; and they that
        rejoice, as though they rejoiced not; and they that buy, as
        though they possessed not;

007:031 And they that use this world, as not abusing it: for the
        fashion of this world passeth away.

007:032 But I would have you without carefulness. He that is unmarried
        careth for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may
        please the Lord:

007:033 But he that is married careth for the things that are of the
        world, how he may please his wife.

007:034 There is difference also between a wife and a virgin. The
        unmarried woman careth for the things of the Lord, that she
        may be holy both in body and in spirit: but she that is
        married careth for the things of the world, how she may please
        her husband.

007:035 And this I speak for your own profit; not that I may cast a
        snare upon you, but for that which is comely, and that ye may
        attend upon the Lord without distraction.

007:036 But if any man think that he behaveth himself uncomely toward
        his virgin, if she pass the flower of her age, and need so
        require, let him do what he will, he sinneth not: let them
        marry.

007:037 Nevertheless he that standeth stedfast in his heart, having no
        necessity, but hath power over his own will, and hath so
        decreed in his heart that he will keep his virgin, doeth well.

007:038 So then he that giveth her in marriage doeth well; but he that
        giveth her not in marriage doeth better.

007:039 The wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth;
        but if her husband be dead, she is at liberty to be married to
        whom she will; only in the Lord.

007:040 But she is happier if she so abide, after my judgment: and I
        think also that I have the Spirit of God.

008:001 Now as touching things offered unto idols, we know that we all
        have knowledge. Knowledge puffeth up, but charity edifieth.

008:002 And if any man think that he knoweth any thing, he knoweth
        nothing yet as he ought to know.

008:003 But if any man love God, the same is known of him.

008:004 As concerning therefore the eating of those things that are
        offered in sacrifice unto idols, we know that an idol is
        nothing in the world, and that there is none other God but
        one.

008:005 For though there be that are called gods, whether in heaven or
        in earth, (as there be gods many, and lords many,)

008:006 But to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all
        things, and we in him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are
        all things, and we by him.

008:007 Howbeit there is not in every man that knowledge: for some
        with conscience of the idol unto this hour eat it as a thing
        offered unto an idol; and their conscience being weak is
        defiled.

008:008 But meat commendeth us not to God: for neither, if we eat, are
        we the better; neither, if we eat not, are we the worse.

008:009 But take heed lest by any means this liberty of your's become
        a stumblingblock to them that are weak.

008:010 For if any man see thee which hast knowledge sit at meat in
        the idol's temple, shall not the conscience of him which is
        weak be emboldened to eat those things which are offered to
        idols;

008:011 And through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish, for
        whom Christ died?

008:012 But when ye sin so against the brethren, and wound their weak
        conscience, ye sin against Christ.

008:013 Wherefore, if meat make my brother to offend, I will eat no
        flesh while the world standeth, lest I make my brother to
        offend.

009:001 Am I not an apostle? am I not free? have I not seen Jesus
        Christ our Lord? are not ye my work in the Lord?

009:002 If I be not an apostle unto others, yet doubtless I am to you:
        for the seal of mine apostleship are ye in the Lord.

009:003 Mine answer to them that do examine me is this,

009:004 Have we not power to eat and to drink?

009:005 Have we not power to lead about a sister, a wife, as well as
        other apostles, and as the brethren of the Lord, and Cephas?

009:006 Or I only and Barnabas, have not we power to forbear working?

009:007 Who goeth a warfare any time at his own charges? who planteth
        a vineyard, and eateth not of the fruit thereof? or who
        feedeth a flock, and eateth not of the milk of the flock?

009:008 Say I these things as a man? or saith not the law the same
        also?

009:009 For it is written in the law of Moses, Thou shalt not muzzle
        the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn. Doth God take
        care for oxen?

009:010 Or saith he it altogether for our sakes? For our sakes, no
        doubt, this is written: that he that ploweth should plow in
        hope; and that he that thresheth in hope should be partaker of
        his hope.

009:011 If we have sown unto you spiritual things, is it a great thing
        if we shall reap your carnal things?

009:012 If others be partakers of this power over you, are not we
        rather? Nevertheless we have not used this power; but suffer
        all things, lest we should hinder the gospel of Christ.

009:013 Do ye not know that they which minister about holy things live
        of the things of the temple? and they which wait at the altar
        are partakers with the altar?

009:014 Even so hath the Lord ordained that they which preach the
        gospel should live of the gospel.

009:015 But I have used none of these things: neither have I written
        these things, that it should be so done unto me: for it were
        better for me to die, than that any man should make my
        glorying void.

009:016 For though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of:
        for necessity is laid upon me; yea, woe is unto me, if I
        preach not the gospel!

009:017 For if I do this thing willingly, I have a reward: but if
        against my will, a dispensation of the gospel is committed
        unto me.

009:018 What is my reward then? Verily that, when I preach the gospel,
        I may make the gospel of Christ without charge, that I abuse
        not my power in the gospel.

009:019 For though I be free from all men, yet have I made myself
        servant unto all, that I might gain the more.

009:020 And unto the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain the
        Jews; to them that are under the law, as under the law, that I
        might gain them that are under the law;

009:021 To them that are without law, as without law, (being not
        without law to God, but under the law to Christ,) that I might
        gain them that are without law.

009:022 To the weak became I as weak, that I might gain the weak: I am
        made all things to all men, that I might by all means save
        some.

009:023 And this I do for the gospel's sake, that I might be partaker
        thereof with you.

009:024 Know ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one
        receiveth the prize? So run, that ye may obtain.

009:025 And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in
        all things. Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown; but
        we an incorruptible.

009:026 I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so fight I, not as one
        that beateth the air:

009:027 But I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection: lest
        that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself
        should be a castaway.

010:001 Moreover, brethren, I would not that ye should be ignorant,
        how that all our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed
        through the sea;

010:002 And were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea;

010:003 And did all eat the same spiritual meat;

010:004 And did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of
        that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was
        Christ.

010:005 But with many of them God was not well pleased: for they were
        overthrown in the wilderness.

010:006 Now these things were our examples, to the intent we should
        not lust after evil things, as they also lusted.

010:007 Neither be ye idolaters, as were some of them; as it is
        written, The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to
        play.

010:008 Neither let us commit fornication, as some of them committed,
        and fell in one day three and twenty thousand.

010:009 Neither let us tempt Christ, as some of them also tempted, and
        were destroyed of serpents.

010:010 Neither murmur ye, as some of them also murmured, and were
        destroyed of the destroyer.

010:011 Now all these things happened unto them for ensamples: and
        they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the
        world are come.

010:012 Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he
        fall.

010:013 There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to
        man: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be
        tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation
        also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it.

010:014 Wherefore, my dearly beloved, flee from idolatry.

010:015 I speak as to wise men; judge ye what I say.

010:016 The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of
        the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the
        communion of the body of Christ?

010:017 For we being many are one bread, and one body: for we are all
        partakers of that one bread.

010:018 Behold Israel after the flesh: are not they which eat of the
        sacrifices partakers of the altar?

010:019 What say I then? that the idol is any thing, or that which is
        offered in sacrifice to idols is any thing?

010:020 But I say, that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they
        sacrifice to devils, and not to God: and I would not that ye
        should have fellowship with devils.

010:021 Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of devils: ye
        cannot be partakers of the Lord's table, and of the table of
        devils.

010:022 Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? are we stronger than he?

010:023 All things are lawful for me, but all things are not
        expedient: all things are lawful for me, but all things edify
        not.

010:024 Let no man seek his own, but every man another's wealth.

010:025 Whatsoever is sold in the shambles, that eat, asking no
        question for conscience sake:

010:026 For the earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof.

010:027 If any of them that believe not bid you to a feast, and ye be
        disposed to go; whatsoever is set before you, eat, asking no
        question for conscience sake.

010:028 But if any man say unto you, This is offered in sacrifice unto
        idols, eat not for his sake that shewed it, and for conscience
        sake: for the earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof:

010:029 Conscience, I say, not thine own, but of the other: for why is
        my liberty judged of another man's conscience?

010:030 For if I by grace be a partaker, why am I evil spoken of for
        that for which I give thanks?

010:031 Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do
        all to the glory of God.

010:032 Give none offence, neither to the Jews, nor to the Gentiles,
        nor to the church of God:

010:033 Even as I please all men in all things, not seeking mine own
        profit, but the profit of many, that they may be saved.

011:001 Be ye followers of me, even as I also am of Christ.

011:002 Now I praise you, brethren, that ye remember me in all things,
        and keep the ordinances, as I delivered them to you.

011:003 But I would have you know, that the head of every man is
        Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of
        Christ is God.

011:004 Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered,
        dishonoureth his head.

011:005 But every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head
        uncovered dishonoureth her head: for that is even all one as
        if she were shaven.

011:006 For if the woman be not covered, let her also be shorn: but if
        it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be
        covered.

011:007 For a man indeed ought not to cover his head, forasmuch as he
        is the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of
        the man.

011:008 For the man is not of the woman: but the woman of the man.

011:009 Neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for
        the man.

011:010 For this cause ought the woman to have power on her head
        because of the angels.

011:011 Nevertheless neither is the man without the woman, neither the
        woman without the man, in the Lord.

011:012 For as the woman is of the man, even so is the man also by the
        woman; but all things of God.

011:013 Judge in yourselves: is it comely that a woman pray unto God
        uncovered?

011:014 Doth not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have
        long hair, it is a shame unto him?

011:015 But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for her
        hair is given her for a covering.

011:016 But if any man seem to be contentious, we have no such custom,
        neither the churches of God.

011:017 Now in this that I declare unto you I praise you not, that ye
        come together not for the better, but for the worse.

011:018 For first of all, when ye come together in the church, I hear
        that there be divisions among you; and I partly believe it.

011:019 For there must be also heresies among you, that they which are
        approved may be made manifest among you.

011:020 When ye come together therefore into one place, this is not to
        eat the Lord's supper.

011:021 For in eating every one taketh before other his own supper:
        and one is hungry, and another is drunken.

011:022 What? have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? or despise ye
        the church of God, and shame them that have not? What shall I
        say to you? shall I praise you in this? I praise you not.

011:023 For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered
        unto you, That the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was
        betrayed took bread:

011:024 And when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take,
        eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in
        remembrance of me.

011:025 After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had
        supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood:
        this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me.

011:026 For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do
        shew the Lord's death till he come.

011:027 Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup
        of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood
        of the Lord.

011:028 But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that
        bread, and drink of that cup.

011:029 For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and
        drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body.

011:030 For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many
        sleep.

011:031 For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged.

011:032 But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we
        should not be condemned with the world.

011:033 Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, tarry
        one for another.

011:034 And if any man hunger, let him eat at home; that ye come not
        together unto condemnation. And the rest will I set in order
        when I come.

012:001 Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not have you
        ignorant.

012:002 Ye know that ye were Gentiles, carried away unto these dumb
        idols, even as ye were led.

012:003 Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking by
        the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed: and that no man can
        say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.

012:004 Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit.

012:005 And there are differences of administrations, but the same
        Lord.

012:006 And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same
        God which worketh all in all.

012:007 But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to
        profit withal.

012:008 For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to
        another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit;

012:009 To another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of
        healing by the same Spirit;

012:010 To another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to
        another discerning of spirits; to another divers kinds of
        tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues:

012:011 But all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit,
        dividing to every man severally as he will.

012:012 For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the
        members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also is
        Christ.

012:013 For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether
        we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have
        been all made to drink into one Spirit.

012:014 For the body is not one member, but many.

012:015 If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of
        the body; is it therefore not of the body?

012:016 And if the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not
        of the body; is it therefore not of the body?

012:017 If the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing? If the
        whole were hearing, where were the smelling?

012:018 But now hath God set the members every one of them in the
        body, as it hath pleased him.

012:019 And if they were all one member, where were the body?

012:020 But now are they many members, yet but one body.

012:021 And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of thee:
        nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.

012:022 Nay, much more those members of the body, which seem to be
        more feeble, are necessary:

012:023 And those members of the body, which we think to be less
        honourable, upon these we bestow more abundant honour; and our
        uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness.

012:024 For our comely parts have no need: but God hath tempered the
        body together, having given more abundant honour to that part
        which lacked.

012:025 That there should be no schism in the body; but that the
        members should have the same care one for another.

012:026 And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it;
        or one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with it.

012:027 Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular.

012:028 And God hath set some in the church, first apostles,
        secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles,
        then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of
        tongues.

012:029 Are all apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? are all
        workers of miracles?

012:030 Have all the gifts of healing? do all speak with tongues? do
        all interpret?

012:031 But covet earnestly the best gifts: and yet shew I unto you a
        more excellent way.

013:001 Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have
        not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling
        cymbal.

013:002 And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all
        mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so
        that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am
        nothing.

013:003 And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though
        I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it
        profiteth me nothing.

013:004 Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not;
        charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up,

013:005 Doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not
        easily provoked, thinketh no evil;

013:006 Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth;

013:007 Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things,
        endureth all things.

013:008 Charity never faileth: but whether there be prophecies, they
        shall fail; whether there be tongues, they shall cease;
        whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away.

013:009 For we know in part, and we prophesy in part.

013:010 But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in
        part shall be done away.

013:011 When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a
        child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put
        away childish things.

013:012 For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face:
        now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am
        known.

013:013 And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the
        greatest of these is charity.

014:001 Follow after charity, and desire spiritual gifts, but rather
        that ye may prophesy.

014:002 For he that speaketh in an unknown tongue speaketh not unto
        men, but unto God: for no man understandeth him; howbeit in
        the spirit he speaketh mysteries.

014:003 But he that prophesieth speaketh unto men to edification, and
        exhortation, and comfort.

014:004 He that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifieth himself; but he
        that prophesieth edifieth the church.

014:005 I would that ye all spake with tongues but rather that ye
        prophesied: for greater is he that prophesieth than he that
        speaketh with tongues, except he interpret, that the church
        may receive edifying.

014:006 Now, brethren, if I come unto you speaking with tongues, what
        shall I profit you, except I shall speak to you either by
        revelation, or by knowledge, or by prophesying, or by
        doctrine?

014:007 And even things without life giving sound, whether pipe or
        harp, except they give a distinction in the sounds, how shall
        it be known what is piped or harped?

014:008 For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare
        himself to the battle?

014:009 So likewise ye, except ye utter by the tongue words easy to be
        understood, how shall it be known what is spoken? for ye shall
        speak into the air.

014:010 There are, it may be, so many kinds of voices in the world,
        and none of them is without signification.

014:011 Therefore if I know not the meaning of the voice, I shall be
        unto him that speaketh a barbarian, and he that speaketh shall
        be a barbarian unto me.

014:012 Even so ye, forasmuch as ye are zealous of spiritual gifts,
        seek that ye may excel to the edifying of the church.

014:013 Wherefore let him that speaketh in an unknown tongue pray that
        he may interpret.

014:014 For if I pray in an unknown tongue, my spirit prayeth, but my
        understanding is unfruitful.

014:015 What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray
        with the understanding also: I will sing with the spirit, and
        I will sing with the understanding also.

014:016 Else when thou shalt bless with the spirit, how shall he that
        occupieth the room of the unlearned say Amen at thy giving of
        thanks, seeing he understandeth not what thou sayest?

014:017 For thou verily givest thanks well, but the other is not
        edified.

014:018 I thank my God, I speak with tongues more than ye all:

014:019 Yet in the church I had rather speak five words with my
        understanding, that by my voice I might teach others also,
        than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue.

014:020 Brethren, be not children in understanding: howbeit in malice
        be ye children, but in understanding be men.

014:021 In the law it is written, With men of other tongues and other
        lips will I speak unto this people; and yet for all that will
        they not hear me, saith the Lord.

014:022 Wherefore tongues are for a sign, not to them that believe,
        but to them that believe not: but prophesying serveth not for
        them that believe not, but for them which believe.

014:023 If therefore the whole church be come together into one place,
        and all speak with tongues, and there come in those that are
        unlearned, or unbelievers, will they not say that ye are mad?

014:024 But if all prophesy, and there come in one that believeth not,
        or one unlearned, he is convinced of all, he is judged of all:

014:025 And thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest; and so
        falling down on his face he will worship God, and report that
        God is in you of a truth.

014:026 How is it then, brethren? when ye come together, every one of
        you hath a psalm, hath a doctrine, hath a tongue, hath a
        revelation, hath an interpretation. Let all things be done
        unto edifying.

014:027 If any man speak in an unknown tongue, let it be by two, or at
        the most by three, and that by course; and let one interpret.

014:028 But if there be no interpreter, let him keep silence in the
        church; and let him speak to himself, and to God.

014:029 Let the prophets speak two or three, and let the other judge.

014:030 If any thing be revealed to another that sitteth by, let the
        first hold his peace.

014:031 For ye may all prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and
        all may be comforted.

014:032 And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets.

014:033 For God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as in
        all churches of the saints.

014:034 Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not
        permitted unto them to speak; but they are commanded to be
        under obedience as also saith the law.

014:035 And if they will learn any thing, let them ask their husbands
        at home: for it is a shame for women to speak in the church.

014:036 What? came the word of God out from you? or came it unto you
        only?

014:037 If any man think himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let
        him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the
        commandments of the Lord.

014:038 But if any man be ignorant, let him be ignorant.

014:039 Wherefore, brethren, covet to prophesy, and forbid not to
        speak with tongues.

014:040 Let all things be done decently and in order.

015:001 Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I
        preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye
        stand;

015:002 By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I
        preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.

015:003 For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also
        received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the
        scriptures;

015:004 And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day
        according to the scriptures:

015:005 And that he was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve:

015:006 After that, he was seen of above five hundred brethren at
        once; of whom the greater part remain unto this present, but
        some are fallen asleep.

015:007 After that, he was seen of James; then of all the apostles.

015:008 And last of all he was seen of me also, as of one born out of
        due time.

015:009 For I am the least of the apostles, that am not meet to be
        called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.

015:010 But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which
        was bestowed upon me was not in vain; but I laboured more
        abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God
        which was with me.

015:011 Therefore whether it were I or they, so we preach, and so ye
        believed.

015:012 Now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead, how say
        some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead?

015:013 But if there be no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ
        not risen:

015:014 And if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and
        your faith is also vain.

015:015 Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God; because we have
        testified of God that he raised up Christ: whom he raised not
        up, if so be that the dead rise not.

015:016 For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised:

015:017 And if Christ be not raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in
        your sins.

015:018 Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished.

015:019 If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men
        most miserable.

015:020 But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the
        firstfruits of them that slept.

015:021 For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection
        of the dead.

015:022 For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made
        alive.

015:023 But every man in his own order: Christ the firstfruits;
        afterward they that are Christ's at his coming.

015:024 Then cometh the end, when he shall have delivered up the
        kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down
        all rule and all authority and power.

015:025 For he must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his
        feet.

015:026 The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death.

015:027 For he hath put all things under his feet. But when he saith
        all things are put under him, it is manifest that he is
        excepted, which did put all things under him.

015:028 And when all things shall be subdued unto him, then shall the
        Son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under
        him, that God may be all in all.

015:029 Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if
        the dead rise not at all? why are they then baptized for the
        dead?

015:030 And why stand we in jeopardy every hour?

015:031 I protest by your rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our
        Lord, I die daily.

015:032 If after the manner of men I have fought with beasts at
        Ephesus, what advantageth it me, if the dead rise not? let us
        eat and drink; for to morrow we die.

015:033 Be not deceived: evil communications corrupt good manners.

015:034 Awake to righteousness, and sin not; for some have not the
        knowledge of God: I speak this to your shame.

015:035 But some man will say, How are the dead raised up? and with
        what body do they come?

015:036 Thou fool, that which thou sowest is not quickened, except it
        die:

015:037 And that which thou sowest, thou sowest not that body that
        shall be, but bare grain, it may chance of wheat, or of some
        other grain:

015:038 But God giveth it a body as it hath pleased him, and to every
        seed his own body.

015:039 All flesh is not the same flesh: but there is one kind of
        flesh of men, another flesh of beasts, another of fishes, and
        another of birds.

015:040 There are also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but
        the glory of the celestial is one, and the glory of the
        terrestrial is another.

015:041 There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon,
        and another glory of the stars: for one star differeth from
        another star in glory.

015:042 So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in
        corruption; it is raised in incorruption:

015:043 It is sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory: it is sown in
        weakness; it is raised in power:

015:044 It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body.
        There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.

015:045 And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living
        soul; the last Adam was made a quickening spirit.

015:046 Howbeit that was not first which is spiritual, but that which
        is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual.

015:047 The first man is of the earth, earthy; the second man is the
        Lord from heaven.

015:048 As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy: and as
        is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly.

015:049 And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also
        bear the image of the heavenly.

015:050 Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit
        the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit
        incorruption.

015:051 Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we
        shall all be changed,

015:052 In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump:
        for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised
        incorruptible, and we shall be changed.

015:053 For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal
        must put on immortality.

015:054 So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and
        this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be
        brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed
        up in victory.

015:055 O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?

015:056 The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law.

015:057 But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our
        Lord Jesus Christ.

015:058 Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable,
        always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know
        that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.

016:001 Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I have given
        order to the churches of Galatia, even so do ye.

016:002 Upon the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him
        in store, as God hath prospered him, that there be no
        gatherings when I come.

016:003 And when I come, whomsoever ye shall approve by your letters,
        them will I send to bring your liberality unto Jerusalem.

016:004 And if it be meet that I go also, they shall go with me.

016:005 Now I will come unto you, when I shall pass through Macedonia:
        for I do pass through Macedonia.

016:006 And it may be that I will abide, yea, and winter with you,
        that ye may bring me on my journey whithersoever I go.

016:007 For I will not see you now by the way; but I trust to tarry a
        while with you, if the Lord permit.

016:008 But I will tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost.

016:009 For a great door and effectual is opened unto me, and there
        are many adversaries.

016:010 Now if Timotheus come, see that he may be with you without
        fear: for he worketh the work of the Lord, as I also do.

016:011 Let no man therefore despise him: but conduct him forth in
        peace, that he may come unto me: for I look for him with the
        brethren.

016:012 As touching our brother Apollos, I greatly desired him to come
        unto you with the brethren: but his will was not at all to
        come at this time; but he will come when he shall have
        convenient time.

016:013 Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, be
        strong.

016:014 Let all your things be done with charity.

016:015 I beseech you, brethren, (ye know the house of Stephanas, that
        it is the firstfruits of Achaia, and that they have addicted
        themselves to the ministry of the saints,)

016:016 That ye submit yourselves unto such, and to every one that
        helpeth with us, and laboureth.

016:017 I am glad of the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and
        Achaicus: for that which was lacking on your part they have
        supplied.

016:018 For they have refreshed my spirit and your's: therefore
        acknowledge ye them that are such.

016:019 The churches of Asia salute you. Aquila and Priscilla salute
        you much in the Lord, with the church that is in their house.

016:020 All the brethren greet you. Greet ye one another with an holy
        kiss.

016:021 The salutation of me Paul with mine own hand.

016:022 If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema
        Maranatha.

016:023 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.

016:024 My love be with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen.

Book 47	2 Corinthians

001:001 Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and
        Timothy our brother, unto the church of God which is at
        Corinth, with all the saints which are in all Achaia:

001:002 Grace be to you and peace from God our Father, and from the
        Lord Jesus Christ.

001:003 Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the
        Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort;

001:004 Who comforteth us in all our tribulation, that we may be able
        to comfort them which are in any trouble, by the comfort
        wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God.

001:005 For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our
        consolation also aboundeth by Christ.

001:006 And whether we be afflicted, it is for your consolation and
        salvation, which is effectual in the enduring of the same
        sufferings which we also suffer: or whether we be comforted,
        it is for your consolation and salvation.

001:007 And our hope of you is stedfast, knowing, that as ye are
        partakers of the sufferings, so shall ye be also of the
        consolation.

001:008 For we would not, brethren, have you ignorant of our trouble
        which came to us in Asia, that we were pressed out of measure,
        above strength, insomuch that we despaired even of life:

001:009 But we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should
        not trust in ourselves, but in God which raiseth the dead:

001:010 Who delivered us from so great a death, and doth deliver: in
        whom we trust that he will yet deliver us;

001:011 Ye also helping together by prayer for us, that for the gift
        bestowed upon us by the means of many persons thanks may be
        given by many on our behalf.

001:012 For our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience,
        that in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly
        wisdom, but by the grace of God, we have had our conversation
        in the world, and more abundantly to you-ward.

001:013 For we write none other things unto you, than what ye read or
        acknowledge; and I trust ye shall acknowledge even to the end;

001:014 As also ye have acknowledged us in part, that we are your
        rejoicing, even as ye also are our's in the day of the Lord
        Jesus.

001:015 And in this confidence I was minded to come unto you before,
        that ye might have a second benefit;

001:016 And to pass by you into Macedonia, and to come again out of
        Macedonia unto you, and of you to be brought on my way toward
        Judaea.

001:017 When I therefore was thus minded, did I use lightness? or the
        things that I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh,
        that with me there should be yea yea, and nay nay?

001:018 But as God is true, our word toward you was not yea and nay.

001:019 For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you
        by us, even by me and Silvanus and Timotheus, was not yea and
        nay, but in him was yea.

001:020 For all the promises of God in him are yea, and in him Amen,
        unto the glory of God by us.

001:021 Now he which stablisheth us with you in Christ, and hath
        anointed us, is God;

001:022 Who hath also sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit
        in our hearts.

001:023 Moreover I call God for a record upon my soul, that to spare
        you I came not as yet unto Corinth.

001:024 Not for that we have dominion over your faith, but are helpers
        of your joy: for by faith ye stand.

002:001 But I determined this with myself, that I would not come again
        to you in heaviness.

002:002 For if I make you sorry, who is he then that maketh me glad,
        but the same which is made sorry by me?

002:003 And I wrote this same unto you, lest, when I came, I should
        have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice; having
        confidence in you all, that my joy is the joy of you all.

002:004 For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto
        you with many tears; not that ye should be grieved, but that
        ye might know the love which I have more abundantly unto you.

002:005 But if any have caused grief, he hath not grieved me, but in
        part: that I may not overcharge you all.

002:006 Sufficient to such a man is this punishment, which was
        inflicted of many.

002:007 So that contrariwise ye ought rather to forgive him, and
        comfort him, lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up
        with overmuch sorrow.

002:008 Wherefore I beseech you that ye would confirm your love toward
        him.

002:009 For to this end also did I write, that I might know the proof
        of you, whether ye be obedient in all things.

002:010 To whom ye forgive any thing, I forgive also: for if I forgave
        any thing, to whom I forgave it, for your sakes forgave I it
        in the person of Christ;

002:011 Lest Satan should get an advantage of us: for we are not
        ignorant of his devices.

002:012 Furthermore, when I came to Troas to preach Christ's gospel,
        and a door was opened unto me of the Lord,

002:013 I had no rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus my
        brother: but taking my leave of them, I went from thence into
        Macedonia.

002:014 Now thanks be unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in
        Christ, and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us
        in every place.

002:015 For we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ, in them that are
        saved, and in them that perish:

002:016 To the one we are the savour of death unto death; and to the
        other the savour of life unto life. And who is sufficient for
        these things?

002:017 For we are not as many, which corrupt the word of God: but as
        of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God speak we in
        Christ.

003:001 Do we begin again to commend ourselves? or need we, as some
        others, epistles of commendation to you, or letters of
        commendation from you?

003:002 Ye are our epistle written in our hearts, known and read of
        all men:

003:003 Forasmuch as ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of
        Christ ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the
        Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in
        fleshy tables of the heart.

003:004 And such trust have we through Christ to God-ward:

003:005 Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as
        of ourselves; but our sufficiency is of God;

003:006 Who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament; not
        of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but
        the spirit giveth life.

003:007 But if the ministration of death, written and engraven in
        stones, was glorious, so that the children of Israel could not
        stedfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his
        countenance; which glory was to be done away:

003:008 How shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather
        glorious?

003:009 For if the ministration of condemnation be glory, much more
        doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory.

003:010 For even that which was made glorious had no glory in this
        respect, by reason of the glory that excelleth.

003:011 For if that which is done away was glorious, much more that
        which remaineth is glorious.

003:012 Seeing then that we have such hope, we use great plainness of
        speech:

003:013 And not as Moses, which put a vail over his face, that the
        children of Israel could not stedfastly look to the end of
        that which is abolished:

003:014 But their minds were blinded: for until this day remaineth the
        same vail untaken away in the reading of the old testament;
        which vail is done away in Christ.

003:015 But even unto this day, when Moses is read, the vail is upon
        their heart.

003:016 Nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord, the vail shall be
        taken away.

003:017 Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord
        is, there is liberty.

003:018 But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory
        of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to
        glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.

004:001 Therefore seeing we have this ministry, as we have received
        mercy, we faint not;

004:002 But have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not
        walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God
        deceitfully; but by manifestation of the truth commending
        ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God.

004:003 But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost:

004:004 In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them
        which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of
        Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them.

004:005 For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord; and
        ourselves your servants for Jesus' sake.

004:006 For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness,
        hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge
        of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.

004:007 But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the
        excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us.

004:008 We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are
        perplexed, but not in despair;

004:009 Persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed;

004:010 Always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus,
        that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our
        body.

004:011 For we which live are alway delivered unto death for Jesus'
        sake, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in
        our mortal flesh.

004:012 So then death worketh in us, but life in you.

004:013 We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is
        written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also
        believe, and therefore speak;

004:014 Knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up
        us also by Jesus, and shall present us with you.

004:015 For all things are for your sakes, that the abundant grace
        might through the thanksgiving of many redound to the glory of
        God.

004:016 For which cause we faint not; but though our outward man
        perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day.

004:017 For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh
        for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory;

004:018 While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the
        things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are
        temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal.

005:001 For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were
        dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with
        hands, eternal in the heavens.

005:002 For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon
        with our house which is from heaven:

005:003 If so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked.

005:004 For we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened:
        not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that
        mortality might be swallowed up of life.

005:005 Now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing is God, who
        also hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit.

005:006 Therefore we are always confident, knowing that, whilst we are
        at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord:

005:007 (For we walk by faith, not by sight:)

005:008 We are confident, I say, and willing rather to be absent from
        the body, and to be present with the Lord.

005:009 Wherefore we labour, that, whether present or absent, we may
        be accepted of him.

005:010 For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ;
        that every one may receive the things done in his body,
        according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.

005:011 Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men; but
        we are made manifest unto God; and I trust also are made
        manifest in your consciences.

005:012 For we commend not ourselves again unto you, but give you
        occasion to glory on our behalf, that ye may have somewhat to
        answer them which glory in appearance, and not in heart.

005:013 For whether we be beside ourselves, it is to God: or whether
        we be sober, it is for your cause.

005:014 For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge,
        that if one died for all, then were all dead:

005:015 And that he died for all, that they which live should not
        henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for
        them, and rose again.

005:016 Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh: yea,
        though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now
        henceforth know we him no more.

005:017 Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old
        things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.

005:018 And all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himself
        by Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of
        reconciliation;

005:019 To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto
        himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath
        committed unto us the word of reconciliation.

005:020 Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did
        beseech you by us: we pray you in Christ's stead, be ye
        reconciled to God.

005:021 For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that
        we might be made the righteousness of God in him.

006:001 We then, as workers together with him, beseech you also that
        ye receive not the grace of God in vain.

006:002 (For he saith, I have heard thee in a time accepted, and in
        the day of salvation have I succoured thee: behold, now is the
        accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation.)

006:003 Giving no offence in any thing, that the ministry be not
        blamed:

006:004 But in all things approving ourselves as the ministers of God,
        in much patience, in afflictions, in necessities, in
        distresses,

006:005 In stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labours, in
        watchings, in fastings;

006:006 By pureness, by knowledge, by longsuffering, by kindness, by
        the Holy Ghost, by love unfeigned,

006:007 By the word of truth, by the power of God, by the armour of
        righteousness on the right hand and on the left,

006:008 By honour and dishonour, by evil report and good report: as
        deceivers, and yet true;

006:009 As unknown, and yet well known; as dying, and, behold, we
        live; as chastened, and not killed;

006:010 As sorrowful, yet alway rejoicing; as poor, yet making many
        rich; as having nothing, and yet possessing all things.

006:011 O ye Corinthians, our mouth is open unto you, our heart is
        enlarged.

006:012 Ye are not straitened in us, but ye are straitened in your own
        bowels.

006:013 Now for a recompence in the same, (I speak as unto my
        children,) be ye also enlarged.

006:014 Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what
        fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what
        communion hath light with darkness?

006:015 And what concord hath Christ with Belial? or what part hath he
        that believeth with an infidel?

006:016 And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? for ye
        are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will
        dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and
        they shall be my people.

006:017 Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith
        the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive
        you.

006:018 And will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and
        daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.

007:001 Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us
        cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit,
        perfecting holiness in the fear of God.

007:002 Receive us; we have wronged no man, we have corrupted no man,
        we have defrauded no man.

007:003 I speak not this to condemn you: for I have said before, that
        ye are in our hearts to die and live with you.

007:004 Great is my boldness of speech toward you, great is my
        glorying of you: I am filled with comfort, I am exceeding
        joyful in all our tribulation.

007:005 For, when we were come into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest,
        but we were troubled on every side; without were fightings,
        within were fears.

007:006 Nevertheless God, that comforteth those that are cast down,
        comforted us by the coming of Titus;

007:007 And not by his coming only, but by the consolation wherewith
        he was comforted in you, when he told us your earnest desire,
        your mourning, your fervent mind toward me; so that I rejoiced
        the more.

007:008 For though I made you sorry with a letter, I do not repent,
        though I did repent: for I perceive that the same epistle hath
        made you sorry, though it were but for a season.

007:009 Now I rejoice, not that ye were made sorry, but that ye
        sorrowed to repentance: for ye were made sorry after a godly
        manner, that ye might receive damage by us in nothing.

007:010 For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be
        repented of: but the sorrow of the world worketh death.

007:011 For behold this selfsame thing, that ye sorrowed after a godly
        sort, what carefulness it wrought in you, yea, what clearing
        of yourselves, yea, what indignation, yea, what fear, yea,
        what vehement desire, yea, what zeal, yea, what revenge! In
        all things ye have approved yourselves to be clear in this
        matter.

007:012 Wherefore, though I wrote unto you, I did it not for his cause
        that had done the wrong, nor for his cause that suffered
        wrong, but that our care for you in the sight of God might
        appear unto you.

007:013 Therefore we were comforted in your comfort: yea, and
        exceedingly the more joyed we for the joy of Titus, because
        his spirit was refreshed by you all.

007:014 For if I have boasted any thing to him of you, I am not
        ashamed; but as we spake all things to you in truth, even so
        our boasting, which I made before Titus, is found a truth.

007:015 And his inward affection is more abundant toward you, whilst
        he remembereth the obedience of you all, how with fear and
        trembling ye received him.

007:016 I rejoice therefore that I have confidence in you in all
        things.

008:001 Moreover, brethren, we do you to wit of the grace of God
        bestowed on the churches of Macedonia;

008:002 How that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their
        joy and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their
        liberality.

008:003 For to their power, I bear record, yea, and beyond their power
        they were willing of themselves;

008:004 Praying us with much intreaty that we would receive the gift,
        and take upon us the fellowship of the ministering to the
        saints.

008:005 And this they did, not as we hoped, but first gave their own
        selves to the Lord, and unto us by the will of God.

008:006 Insomuch that we desired Titus, that as he had begun, so he
        would also finish in you the same grace also.

008:007 Therefore, as ye abound in every thing, in faith, and
        utterance, and knowledge, and in all diligence, and in your
        love to us, see that ye abound in this grace also.

008:008 I speak not by commandment, but by occasion of the forwardness
        of others, and to prove the sincerity of your love.

008:009 For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though
        he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye
        through his poverty might be rich.

008:010 And herein I give my advice: for this is expedient for you,
        who have begun before, not only to do, but also to be forward
        a year ago.

008:011 Now therefore perform the doing of it; that as there was a
        readiness to will, so there may be a performance also out of
        that which ye have.

008:012 For if there be first a willing mind, it is accepted according
        to that a man hath, and not according to that he hath not.

008:013 For I mean not that other men be eased, and ye burdened:

008:014 But by an equality, that now at this time your abundance may
        be a supply for their want, that their abundance also may be a
        supply for your want: that there may be equality:

008:015 As it is written, He that had gathered much had nothing over;
        and he that had gathered little had no lack.

008:016 But thanks be to God, which put the same earnest care into the
        heart of Titus for you.

008:017 For indeed he accepted the exhortation; but being more
        forward, of his own accord he went unto you.

008:018 And we have sent with him the brother, whose praise is in the
        gospel throughout all the churches;

008:019 And not that only, but who was also chosen of the churches to
        travel with us with this grace, which is administered by us to
        the glory of the same Lord, and declaration of your ready
        mind:

008:020 Avoiding this, that no man should blame us in this abundance
        which is administered by us:

008:021 Providing for honest things, not only in the sight of the
        Lord, but also in the sight of men.

008:022 And we have sent with them our brother, whom we have
        oftentimes proved diligent in many things, but now much more
        diligent, upon the great confidence which I have in you.

008:023 Whether any do enquire of Titus, he is my partner and
        fellowhelper concerning you: or our brethren be enquired of,
        they are the messengers of the churches, and the glory of
        Christ.

008:024 Wherefore shew ye to them, and before the churches, the proof
        of your love, and of our boasting on your behalf.

009:001 For as touching the ministering to the saints, it is
        superfluous for me to write to you:

009:002 For I know the forwardness of your mind, for which I boast of
        you to them of Macedonia, that Achaia was ready a year ago;
        and your zeal hath provoked very many.

009:003 Yet have I sent the brethren, lest our boasting of you should
        be in vain in this behalf; that, as I said, ye may be ready:

009:004 Lest haply if they of Macedonia come with me, and find you
        unprepared, we (that we say not, ye) should be ashamed in this
        same confident boasting.

009:005 Therefore I thought it necessary to exhort the brethren, that
        they would go before unto you, and make up beforehand your
        bounty, whereof ye had notice before, that the same might be
        ready, as a matter of bounty, and not as of covetousness.

009:006 But this I say, He which soweth sparingly shall reap also
        sparingly; and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also
        bountifully.

009:007 Every man according as he purposeth in his heart, so let him
        give; not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a
        cheerful giver.

009:008 And God is able to make all grace abound toward you; that ye,
        always having all sufficiency in all things, may abound to
        every good work:

009:009 (As it is written, He hath dispersed abroad; he hath given to
        the poor: his righteousness remaineth for ever.

009:010 Now he that ministereth seed to the sower both minister bread
        for your food, and multiply your seed sown, and increase the
        fruits of your righteousness;)

009:011 Being enriched in every thing to all bountifulness, which
        causeth through us thanksgiving to God.

009:012 For the administration of this service not only supplieth the
        want of the saints, but is abundant also by many thanksgivings
        unto God;

009:013 Whiles by the experiment of this ministration they glorify God
        for your professed subjection unto the gospel of Christ, and
        for your liberal distribution unto them, and unto all men;

009:014 And by their prayer for you, which long after you for the
        exceeding grace of God in you.

009:015 Thanks be unto God for his unspeakable gift.

010:001 Now I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness
        of Christ, who in presence am base among you, but being absent
        am bold toward you:

010:002 But I beseech you, that I may not be bold when I am present
        with that confidence, wherewith I think to be bold against
        some, which think of us as if we walked according to the
        flesh.

010:003 For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the
        flesh:

010:004 (For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty
        through God to the pulling down of strong holds;)

010:005 Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth
        itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into
        captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ;

010:006 And having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience, when
        your obedience is fulfilled.

010:007 Do ye look on things after the outward appearance? If any man
        trust to himself that he is Christ's, let him of himself think
        this again, that, as he is Christ's, even so are we Christ's.

010:008 For though I should boast somewhat more of our authority,
        which the Lord hath given us for edification, and not for your
        destruction, I should not be ashamed:

010:009 That I may not seem as if I would terrify you by letters.

010:010 For his letters, say they, are weighty and powerful; but his
        bodily presence is weak, and his speech contemptible.

010:011 Let such an one think this, that, such as we are in word by
        letters when we are absent, such will we be also in deed when
        we are present.

010:012 For we dare not make ourselves of the number, or compare
        ourselves with some that commend themselves: but they
        measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves
        among themselves, are not wise.

010:013 But we will not boast of things without our measure, but
        according to the measure of the rule which God hath
        distributed to us, a measure to reach even unto you.

010:014 For we stretch not ourselves beyond our measure, as though we
        reached not unto you: for we are come as far as to you also in
        preaching the gospel of Christ:

010:015 Not boasting of things without our measure, that is, of other
        men's labours; but having hope, when your faith is increased,
        that we shall be enlarged by you according to our rule
        abundantly,

010:016 To preach the gospel in the regions beyond you, and not to
        boast in another man's line of things made ready to our hand.

010:017 But he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.

010:018 For not he that commendeth himself is approved, but whom the
        Lord commendeth.

011:001 Would to God ye could bear with me a little in my folly: and
        indeed bear with me.

011:002 For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I have
        espoused you to one husband, that I may present you as a
        chaste virgin to Christ.

011:003 But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve
        through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from
        the simplicity that is in Christ.

011:004 For if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus, whom we have
        not preached, or if ye receive another spirit, which ye have
        not received, or another gospel, which ye have not accepted,
        ye might well bear with him.

011:005 For I suppose I was not a whit behind the very chiefest
        apostles.

011:006 But though I be rude in speech, yet not in knowledge; but we
        have been throughly made manifest among you in all things.

011:007 Have I committed an offence in abasing myself that ye might be
        exalted, because I have preached to you the gospel of God
        freely?

011:008 I robbed other churches, taking wages of them, to do you
        service.

011:009 And when I was present with you, and wanted, I was chargeable
        to no man: for that which was lacking to me the brethren which
        came from Macedonia supplied: and in all things I have kept
        myself from being burdensome unto you, and so will I keep
        myself.

011:010 As the truth of Christ is in me, no man shall stop me of this
        boasting in the regions of Achaia.

011:011 Wherefore? because I love you not? God knoweth.

011:012 But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off occasion
        from them which desire occasion; that wherein they glory, they
        may be found even as we.

011:013 For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming
        themselves into the apostles of Christ.

011:014 And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel
        of light.

011:015 Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be
        transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall
        be according to their works.

011:016 I say again, Let no man think me a fool; if otherwise, yet as
        a fool receive me, that I may boast myself a little.

011:017 That which I speak, I speak it not after the Lord, but as it
        were foolishly, in this confidence of boasting.

011:018 Seeing that many glory after the flesh, I will glory also.

011:019 For ye suffer fools gladly, seeing ye yourselves are wise.

011:020 For ye suffer, if a man bring you into bondage, if a man
        devour you, if a man take of you, if a man exalt himself, if a
        man smite you on the face.

011:021 I speak as concerning reproach, as though we had been weak.
        Howbeit whereinsoever any is bold, (I speak foolishly,) I am
        bold also.

011:022 Are they Hebrews? so am I. Are they Israelites? so am I. Are
        they the seed of Abraham? so am I.

011:023 Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as a fool) I am more;
        in labours more abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons
        more frequent, in deaths oft.

011:024 Of the Jews five times received I forty stripes save one.

011:025 Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I
        suffered shipwreck, a night and a day I have been in the deep;

011:026 In journeyings often, in perils of waters, in perils of
        robbers, in perils by mine own countrymen, in perils by the
        heathen, in perils in the city, in perils in the wilderness,
        in perils in the sea, in perils among false brethren;

011:027 In weariness and painfulness, in watchings often, in hunger
        and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness.

011:028 Beside those things that are without, that which cometh upon
        me daily, the care of all the churches.

011:029 Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is offended, and I burn
        not?

011:030 If I must needs glory, I will glory of the things which
        concern mine infirmities.

011:031 The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is blessed
        for evermore, knoweth that I lie not.

011:032 In Damascus the governor under Aretas the king kept the city
        of the Damascenes with a garrison, desirous to apprehend me:

011:033 And through a window in a basket was I let down by the wall,
        and escaped his hands.

012:001 It is not expedient for me doubtless to glory. I will come to
        visions and revelations of the Lord.

012:002 I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago, (whether in
        the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot
        tell: God knoweth;) such an one caught up to the third heaven.

012:003 And I knew such a man, (whether in the body, or out of the
        body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;)

012:004 How that he was caught up into paradise, and heard unspeakable
        words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter.

012:005 Of such an one will I glory: yet of myself I will not glory,
        but in mine infirmities.

012:006 For though I would desire to glory, I shall not be a fool; for
        I will say the truth: but now I forbear, lest any man should
        think of me above that which he seeth me to be, or that he
        heareth of me.

012:007 And lest I should be exalted above measure through the
        abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in
        the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should
        be exalted above measure.

012:008 For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might
        depart from me.

012:009 And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my
        strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore
        will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of
        Christ may rest upon me.

012:010 Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in
        necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ's sake:
        for when I am weak, then am I strong.

012:011 I am become a fool in glorying; ye have compelled me: for I
        ought to have been commended of you: for in nothing am I
        behind the very chiefest apostles, though I be nothing.

012:012 Truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all
        patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds.

012:013 For what is it wherein ye were inferior to other churches,
        except it be that I myself was not burdensome to you? forgive
        me this wrong.

012:014 Behold, the third time I am ready to come to you; and I will
        not be burdensome to you: for I seek not your's but you: for
        the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the
        parents for the children.

012:015 And I will very gladly spend and be spent for you; though the
        more abundantly I love you, the less I be loved.

012:016 But be it so, I did not burden you: nevertheless, being
        crafty, I caught you with guile.

012:017 Did I make a gain of you by any of them whom I sent unto you?

012:018 I desired Titus, and with him I sent a brother. Did Titus make
        a gain of you? walked we not in the same spirit? walked we not
        in the same steps?

012:019 Again, think ye that we excuse ourselves unto you? we speak
        before God in Christ: but we do all things, dearly beloved,
        for your edifying.

012:020 For I fear, lest, when I come, I shall not find you such as I
        would, and that I shall be found unto you such as ye would
        not: lest there be debates, envyings, wraths, strifes,
        backbitings, whisperings, swellings, tumults:

012:021 And lest, when I come again, my God will humble me among you,
        and that I shall bewail many which have sinned already, and
        have not repented of the uncleanness and fornication and
        lasciviousness which they have committed.

013:001 This is the third time I am coming to you. In the mouth of two
        or three witnesses shall every word be established.

013:002 I told you before, and foretell you, as if I were present, the
        second time; and being absent now I write to them which
        heretofore have sinned, and to all other, that, if I come
        again, I will not spare:

013:003 Since ye seek a proof of Christ speaking in me, which to
        you-ward is not weak, but is mighty in you.

013:004 For though he was crucified through weakness, yet he liveth by
        the power of God. For we also are weak in him, but we shall
        live with him by the power of God toward you.

013:005 Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your own
        selves. Know ye not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is
        in you, except ye be reprobates?

013:006 But I trust that ye shall know that we are not reprobates.

013:007 Now I pray to God that ye do no evil; not that we should
        appear approved, but that ye should do that which is honest,
        though we be as reprobates.

013:008 For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth.

013:009 For we are glad, when we are weak, and ye are strong: and this
        also we wish, even your perfection.

013:010 Therefore I write these things being absent, lest being
        present I should use sharpness, according to the power which
        the Lord hath given me to edification, and not to destruction.

013:011 Finally, brethren, farewell. Be perfect, be of good comfort,
        be of one mind, live in peace; and the God of love and peace
        shall be with you.

013:012 Greet one another with an holy kiss.

013:013 All the saints salute you.

013:014 The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and
        the communion of the Holy Ghost, be with you all. Amen.

Book 48	Galatians

001:001 Paul, an apostle, (not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus
        Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead;)

001:002 And all the brethren which are with me, unto the churches of
        Galatia:

001:003 Grace be to you and peace from God the Father, and from our
        Lord Jesus Christ,

001:004 Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from
        this present evil world, according to the will of God and our
        Father:

001:005 To whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.

001:006 I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you
        into the grace of Christ unto another gospel:

001:007 Which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and
        would pervert the gospel of Christ.

001:008 But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other
        gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let
        him be accursed.

001:009 As we said before, so say I now again, if any man preach any
        other gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him be
        accursed.

001:010 For do I now persuade men, or God? or do I seek to please men?
        for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of
        Christ.

001:011 But I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was
        preached of me is not after man.

001:012 For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it, but
        by the revelation of Jesus Christ.

001:013 For ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews'
        religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of
        God, and wasted it:

001:014 And profited in the Jews' religion above many my equals in
        mine own nation, being more exceedingly zealous of the
        traditions of my fathers.

001:015 But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother's
        womb, and called me by his grace,

001:016 To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the
        heathen; immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood:

001:017 Neither went I up to Jerusalem to them which were apostles
        before me; but I went into Arabia, and returned again unto
        Damascus.

001:018 Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter,
        and abode with him fifteen days.

001:019 But other of the apostles saw I none, save James the Lord's
        brother.

001:020 Now the things which I write unto you, behold, before God, I
        lie not.

001:021 Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia;

001:022 And was unknown by face unto the churches of Judaea which were
        in Christ:

001:023 But they had heard only, That he which persecuted us in times
        past now preacheth the faith which once he destroyed.

001:024 And they glorified God in me.

002:001 Then fourteen years after I went up again to Jerusalem with
        Barnabas, and took Titus with me also.

002:002 And I went up by revelation, and communicated unto them that
        gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to
        them which were of reputation, lest by any means I should run,
        or had run, in vain.

002:003 But neither Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was
        compelled to be circumcised:

002:004 And that because of false brethren unawares brought in, who
        came in privily to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ
        Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage:

002:005 To whom we gave place by subjection, no, not for an hour; that
        the truth of the gospel might continue with you.

002:006 But of these who seemed to be somewhat, (whatsoever they were,
        it maketh no matter to me: God accepteth no man's person:) for
        they who seemed to be somewhat in conference added nothing to
        me:

002:007 But contrariwise, when they saw that the gospel of the
        uncircumcision was committed unto me, as the gospel of the
        circumcision was unto Peter;

002:008 (For he that wrought effectually in Peter to the apostleship
        of the circumcision, the same was mighty in me toward the
        Gentiles:)

002:009 And when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars,
        perceived the grace that was given unto me, they gave to me
        and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship; that we should go
        unto the heathen, and they unto the circumcision.

002:010 Only they would that we should remember the poor; the same
        which I also was forward to do.

002:011 But when Peter was come to Antioch, I withstood him to the
        face, because he was to be blamed.

002:012 For before that certain came from James, he did eat with the
        Gentiles: but when they were come, he withdrew and separated
        himself, fearing them which were of the circumcision.

002:013 And the other Jews dissembled likewise with him; insomuch that
        Barnabas also was carried away with their dissimulation.

002:014 But when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the
        truth of the gospel, I said unto Peter before them all, If
        thou, being a Jew, livest after the manner of Gentiles, and
        not as do the Jews, why compellest thou the Gentiles to live
        as do the Jews?

002:015 We who are Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles,

002:016 Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law,
        but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in
        Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of
        Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of
        the law shall no flesh be justified.

002:017 But if, while we seek to be justified by Christ, we ourselves
        also are found sinners, is therefore Christ the minister of
        sin? God forbid.

002:018 For if I build again the things which I destroyed, I make
        myself a transgressor.

002:019 For I through the law am dead to the law, that I might live
        unto God.

002:020 I am crucified with Christ: neverthless I live; yet not I, but
        Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the
        flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and
        gave himself for me.

002:021 I do not frustrate the grace of God: for if righteousness come
        by the law, then Christ is dead in vain.

003:001 O foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched you, that ye should
        not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been
        evidently set forth, crucified among you?

003:002 This only would I learn of you, Received ye the Spirit by the
        works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?

003:003 Are ye so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made
        perfect by the flesh?

003:004 Have ye suffered so many things in vain? if it be yet in vain.

003:005 He therefore that ministereth to you the Spirit, and worketh
        miracles among you, doeth he it by the works of the law, or by
        the hearing of faith?

003:006 Even as Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for
        righteousness.

003:007 Know ye therefore that they which are of faith, the same are
        the children of Abraham.

003:008 And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the
        heathen through faith, preached before the gospel unto
        Abraham, saying, In thee shall all nations be blessed.

003:009 So then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful
        Abraham.

003:010 For as many as are of the works of the law are under the
        curse: for it is written, Cursed is every one that continueth
        not in all things which are written in the book of the law to
        do them.

003:011 But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God,
        it is evident: for, The just shall live by faith.

003:012 And the law is not of faith: but, The man that doeth them
        shall live in them.

003:013 Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made
        a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that
        hangeth on a tree:

003:014 That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles
        through Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the
        Spirit through faith.

003:015 Brethren, I speak after the manner of men; Though it be but a
        man's covenant, yet if it be confirmed, no man disannulleth,
        or addeth thereto.

003:016 Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith
        not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed,
        which is Christ.

003:017 And this I say, that the covenant, that was confirmed before
        of God in Christ, the law, which was four hundred and thirty
        years after, cannot disannul, that it should make the promise
        of none effect.

003:018 For if the inheritance be of the law, it is no more of
        promise: but God gave it to Abraham by promise.

003:019 Wherefore then serveth the law? It was added because of
        transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise
        was made; and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a
        mediator.

003:020 Now a mediator is not a mediator of one, but God is one.

003:021 Is the law then against the promises of God? God forbid: for
        if there had been a law given which could have given life,
        verily righteousness should have been by the law.

003:022 But the scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the
        promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that
        believe.

003:023 But before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up
        unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed.

003:024 Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto
        Christ, that we might be justified by faith.

003:025 But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a
        schoolmaster.

003:026 For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.

003:027 For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put
        on Christ.

003:028 There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor
        free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in
        Christ Jesus.

003:029 And if ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs
        according to the promise.

004:001 Now I say, That the heir, as long as he is a child, differeth
        nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all;

004:002 But is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of
        the father.

004:003 Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the
        elements of the world:

004:004 But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his
        Son, made of a woman, made under the law,

004:005 To redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive
        the adoption of sons.

004:006 And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his
        Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.

004:007 Wherefore thou art no more a servant, but a son; and if a son,
        then an heir of God through Christ.

004:008 Howbeit then, when ye knew not God, ye did service unto them
        which by nature are no gods.

004:009 But now, after that ye have known God, or rather are known of
        God, how turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements,
        whereunto ye desire again to be in bondage?

004:010 Ye observe days, and months, and times, and years.

004:011 I am afraid of you, lest I have bestowed upon you labour in
        vain.

004:012 Brethren, I beseech you, be as I am; for I am as ye are: ye
        have not injured me at all.

004:013 Ye know how through infirmity of the flesh I preached the
        gospel unto you at the first.

004:014 And my temptation which was in my flesh ye despised not, nor
        rejected; but received me as an angel of God, even as Christ
        Jesus.

004:015 Where is then the blessedness ye spake of? for I bear you
        record, that, if it had been possible, ye would have plucked
        out your own eyes, and have given them to me.

004:016 Am I therefore become your enemy, because I tell you the
        truth?

004:017 They zealously affect you, but not well; yea, they would
        exclude you, that ye might affect them.

004:018 But it is good to be zealously affected always in a good
        thing, and not only when I am present with you.

004:019 My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until
        Christ be formed in you,

004:020 I desire to be present with you now, and to change my voice;
        for I stand in doubt of you.

004:021 Tell me, ye that desire to be under the law, do ye not hear
        the law?

004:022 For it is written, that Abraham had two sons, the one by a
        bondmaid, the other by a freewoman.

004:023 But he who was of the bondwoman was born after the flesh; but
        he of the freewoman was by promise.

004:024 Which things are an allegory: for these are the two covenants;
        the one from the mount Sinai, which gendereth to bondage,
        which is Agar.

004:025 For this Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and answereth to
        Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children.

004:026 But Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of
        us all.

004:027 For it is written, Rejoice, thou barren that bearest not;
        break forth and cry, thou that travailest not: for the
        desolate hath many more children than she which hath an
        husband.

004:028 Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of promise.

004:029 But as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him
        that was born after the Spirit, even so it is now.

004:030 Nevertheless what saith the scripture? Cast out the bondwoman
        and her son: for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir
        with the son of the freewoman.

004:031 So then, brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman, but
        of the free.

005:001 Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made
        us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage.

005:002 Behold, I Paul say unto you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ
        shall profit you nothing.

005:003 For I testify again to every man that is circumcised, that he
        is a debtor to do the whole law.

005:004 Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are
        justified by the law; ye are fallen from grace.

005:005 For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness
        by faith.

005:006 For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing,
        nor uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love.

005:007 Ye did run well; who did hinder you that ye should not obey
        the truth?

005:008 This persuasion cometh not of him that calleth you.

005:009 A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump.

005:010 I have confidence in you through the Lord, that ye will be
        none otherwise minded: but he that troubleth you shall bear
        his judgment, whosoever he be.

005:011 And I, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why do I yet
        suffer persecution? then is the offence of the cross ceased.

005:012 I would they were even cut off which trouble you.

005:013 For, brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only use not
        liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one
        another.

005:014 For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this; Thou
        shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.

005:015 But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be
        not consumed one of another.

005:016 This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil
        the lust of the flesh.

005:017 For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit
        against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the
        other: so that ye cannot do the things that ye would.

005:018 But if ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not under the law.

005:019 Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these;
        Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,

005:020 Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath,
        strife, seditions, heresies,

005:021 Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of
        the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time
        past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the
        kingdom of God.

005:022 But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace,
        longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith,

005:023 Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law.

005:024 And they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the
        affections and lusts.

005:025 If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.

005:026 Let us not be desirous of vain glory, provoking one another,
        envying one another.

006:001 Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are
        spiritual, restore such an one in the spirit of meekness;
        considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted.

006:002 Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of
        Christ.

006:003 For if a man think himself to be something, when he is
        nothing, he deceiveth himself.

006:004 But let every man prove his own work, and then shall he have
        rejoicing in himself alone, and not in another.

006:005 For every man shall bear his own burden.

006:006 Let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that
        teacheth in all good things.

006:007 Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man
        soweth, that shall he also reap.

006:008 For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap
        corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the
        Spirit reap life everlasting.

006:009 And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we
        shall reap, if we faint not.

006:010 As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all men,
        especially unto them who are of the household of faith.

006:011 Ye see how large a letter I have written unto you with mine
        own hand.

006:012 As many as desire to make a fair shew in the flesh, they
        constrain you to be circumcised; only lest they should suffer
        persecution for the cross of Christ.

006:013 For neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law;
        but desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory in
        your flesh.

006:014 But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our
        Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and
        I unto the world.

006:015 For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing,
        nor uncircumcision, but a new creature.

006:016 And as many as walk according to this rule, peace be on them,
        and mercy, and upon the Israel of God.

006:017 From henceforth let no man trouble me: for I bear in my body
        the marks of the Lord Jesus.

006:018 Brethren, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your
        spirit. Amen.

Book 49	Ephesians

001:001 Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, to the
        saints which are at Ephesus, and to the faithful in Christ
        Jesus:

001:002 Grace be to you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the
        Lord Jesus Christ.

001:003 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who
        hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly
        places in Christ:

001:004 According as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of
        the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him
        in love:

001:005 Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus
        Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will,

001:006 To the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made
        us accepted in the beloved.

001:007 In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness
        of sins, according to the riches of his grace;

001:008 Wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence;

001:009 Having made known unto us the mystery of his will, according
        to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself:

001:010 That in the dispensation of the fulness of times he might
        gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in
        heaven, and which are on earth; even in him:

001:011 In whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being
        predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all
        things after the counsel of his own will:

001:012 That we should be to the praise of his glory, who first
        trusted in Christ.

001:013 In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of
        truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that
        ye believed, ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise,

001:014 Which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption
        of the purchased possession, unto the praise of his glory.

001:015 Wherefore I also, after I heard of your faith in the Lord
        Jesus, and love unto all the saints,

001:016 Cease not to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my
        prayers;

001:017 That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory,
        may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the
        knowledge of him:

001:018 The eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that ye may
        know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of
        the glory of his inheritance in the saints,

001:019 And what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward
        who believe, according to the working of his mighty power,

001:020 Which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead,
        and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places,

001:021 Far above all principality, and power, and might, and
        dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this
        world, but also in that which is to come:

001:022 And hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the
        head over all things to the church,

001:023 Which is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all.

002:001 And you hath he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and
        sins;

002:002 Wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this
        world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the
        spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience:

002:003 Among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in
        the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh
        and of the mind; and were by nature the children of wrath,
        even as others.

002:004 But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he
        loved us,

002:005 Even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together
        with Christ, (by grace ye are saved;)

002:006 And hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in
        heavenly places in Christ Jesus:

002:007 That in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of
        his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus.

002:008 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of
        yourselves: it is the gift of God:

002:009 Not of works, lest any man should boast.

002:010 For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good
        works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in
        them.

002:011 Wherefore remember, that ye being in time past Gentiles in the
        flesh, who are called Uncircumcision by that which is called
        the Circumcision in the flesh made by hands;

002:012 That at that time ye were without Christ, being aliens from
        the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants
        of promise, having no hope, and without God in the world:

002:013 But now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were far off are made
        nigh by the blood of Christ.

002:014 For he is our peace, who hath made both one, and hath broken
        down the middle wall of partition between us;

002:015 Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of
        commandments contained in ordinances; for to make in himself
        of twain one new man, so making peace;

002:016 And that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the
        cross, having slain the enmity thereby:

002:017 And came and preached peace to you which were afar off, and to
        them that were nigh.

002:018 For through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the
        Father.

002:019 Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but
        fellowcitizens with the saints, and of the household of God;

002:020 And are built upon the foundation of the apostles and
        prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone;

002:021 In whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an
        holy temple in the Lord:

002:022 In whom ye also are builded together for an habitation of God
        through the Spirit.

003:001 For this cause I Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you
        Gentiles,

003:002 If ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which
        is given me to you-ward:

003:003 How that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery; (as
        I wrote afore in few words,

003:004 Whereby, when ye read, ye may understand my knowledge in the
        mystery of Christ)

003:005 Which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men,
        as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by
        the Spirit;

003:006 That the Gentiles should be fellowheirs, and of the same body,
        and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel:

003:007 Whereof I was made a minister, according to the gift of the
        grace of God given unto me by the effectual working of his
        power.

003:008 Unto me, who am less than the least of all saints, is this
        grace given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the
        unsearchable riches of Christ;

003:009 And to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery,
        which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God,
        who created all things by Jesus Christ:

003:010 To the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in
        heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold
        wisdom of God,

003:011 According to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ
        Jesus our Lord:

003:012 In whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the
        faith of him.

003:013 Wherefore I desire that ye faint not at my tribulations for
        you, which is your glory.

003:014 For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord
        Jesus Christ,

003:015 Of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named,

003:016 That he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory,
        to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man;

003:017 That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being
        rooted and grounded in love,

003:018 May be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth,
        and length, and depth, and height;

003:019 And to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that
        ye might be filled with all the fulness of God.

003:020 Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all
        that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in
        us,

003:021 Unto him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all
        ages, world without end. Amen.

004:001 I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you that ye
        walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called,

004:002 With all lowliness and meekness, with longsuffering,
        forbearing one another in love;

004:003 Endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of
        peace.

004:004 There is one body, and one Spirit, even as ye are called in
        one hope of your calling;

004:005 One Lord, one faith, one baptism,

004:006 One God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all,
        and in you all.

004:007 But unto every one of us is given grace according to the
        measure of the gift of Christ.

004:008 Wherefore he saith, When he ascended up on high, he led
        captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men.

004:009 (Now that he ascended, what is it but that he also descended
        first into the lower parts of the earth?

004:010 He that descended is the same also that ascended up far above
        all heavens, that he might fill all things.)

004:011 And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some,
        evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers;

004:012 For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the
        ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ:

004:013 Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the
        knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the
        measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ:

004:014 That we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro, and
        carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of
        men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to
        deceive;

004:015 But speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all
        things, which is the head, even Christ:

004:016 From whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted
        by that which every joint supplieth, according to the
        effectual working in the measure of every part, maketh
        increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love.

004:017 This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that ye
        henceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk, in the vanity of
        their mind,

004:018 Having the understanding darkened, being alienated from the
        life of God through the ignorance that is in them, because of
        the blindness of their heart:

004:019 Who being past feeling have given themselves over unto
        lasciviousness, to work all uncleanness with greediness.

004:020 But ye have not so learned Christ;

004:021 If so be that ye have heard him, and have been taught by him,
        as the truth is in Jesus:

004:022 That ye put off concerning the former conversation the old
        man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts;

004:023 And be renewed in the spirit of your mind;

004:024 And that ye put on the new man, which after God is created in
        righteousness and true holiness.

004:025 Wherefore putting away lying, speak every man truth with his
        neighbour: for we are members one of another.

004:026 Be ye angry, and sin not: let not the sun go down upon your
        wrath:

004:027 Neither give place to the devil.

004:028 Let him that stole steal no more: but rather let him labour,
        working with his hands the thing which is good, that he may
        have to give to him that needeth.

004:029 Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but
        that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may
        minister grace unto the hearers.

004:030 And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed
        unto the day of redemption.

004:031 Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and
        evil speaking, be put away from you, with all malice:

004:032 And be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one
        another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you.

005:001 Be ye therefore followers of God, as dear children;

005:002 And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given
        himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a
        sweetsmelling savour.

005:003 But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it
        not be once named among you, as becometh saints;

005:004 Neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which
        are not convenient: but rather giving of thanks.

005:005 For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor
        covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the
        kingdom of Christ and of God.

005:006 Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these
        things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of
        disobedience.

005:007 Be not ye therefore partakers with them.

005:008 For ye were sometimes darkness, but now are ye light in the
        Lord: walk as children of light:

005:009 (For the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and
        righteousness and truth;)

005:010 Proving what is acceptable unto the Lord.

005:011 And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness,
        but rather reprove them.

005:012 For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done
        of them in secret.

005:013 But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the
        light: for whatsoever doth make manifest is light.

005:014 Wherefore he saith, Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from
        the dead, and Christ shall give thee light.

005:015 See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as
        wise,

005:016 Redeeming the time, because the days are evil.

005:017 Wherefore be ye not unwise, but understanding what the will of
        the Lord is.

005:018 And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled
        with the Spirit;

005:019 Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual
        songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord;

005:020 Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in
        the name of our Lord Jesus Christ;

005:021 Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God.

005:022 Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the
        Lord.

005:023 For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the
        head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body.

005:024 Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so let the
        wives be to their own husbands in every thing.

005:025 Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the
        church, and gave himself for it;

005:026 That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of
        water by the word,

005:027 That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not
        having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should
        be holy and without blemish.

005:028 So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that
        loveth his wife loveth himself.

005:029 For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and
        cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church:

005:030 For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his
        bones.

005:031 For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and
        shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one
        flesh.

005:032 This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the
        church.

005:033 Nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his
        wife even as himself; and the wife see that she reverence her
        husband.

006:001 Children, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right.

006:002 Honour thy father and mother; which is the first commandment
        with promise;

006:003 That it may be well with thee, and thou mayest live long on
        the earth.

006:004 And, ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but bring
        them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.

006:005 Servants, be obedient to them that are your masters according
        to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your
        heart, as unto Christ;

006:006 Not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but as the servants of
        Christ, doing the will of God from the heart;

006:007 With good will doing service, as to the Lord, and not to men:

006:008 Knowing that whatsoever good thing any man doeth, the same
        shall he receive of the Lord, whether he be bond or free.

006:009 And, ye masters, do the same things unto them, forbearing
        threatening: knowing that your Master also is in heaven;
        neither is there respect of persons with him.

006:010 Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power
        of his might.

006:011 Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand
        against the wiles of the devil.

006:012 For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against
        principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the
        darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high
        places.

006:013 Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may
        be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to
        stand.

006:014 Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and
        having on the breastplate of righteousness;

006:015 And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of
        peace;

006:016 Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be
        able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.

006:017 And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit,
        which is the word of God:

006:018 Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit,
        and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication
        for all saints;

006:019 And for me, that utterance may be given unto me, that I may
        open my mouth boldly, to make known the mystery of the gospel,

006:020 For which I am an ambassador in bonds: that therein I may
        speak boldly, as I ought to speak.

006:021 But that ye also may know my affairs, and how I do, Tychicus,
        a beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, shall
        make known to you all things:

006:022 Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that ye might
        know our affairs, and that he might comfort your hearts.

006:023 Peace be to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the
        Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

006:024 Grace be with all them that love our Lord Jesus Christ in
        sincerity. Amen.

Book 50	Philippians

001:001 Paul and Timotheus, the servants of Jesus Christ, to all the
        saints in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi, with the bishops
        and deacons:

001:002 Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and from
        the Lord Jesus Christ.

001:003 I thank my God upon every remembrance of you,

001:004 Always in every prayer of mine for you all making request with
        joy,

001:005 For your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until
        now;

001:006 Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a
        good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus
        Christ:

001:007 Even as it is meet for me to think this of you all, because I
        have you in my heart; inasmuch as both in my bonds, and in the
        defence and confirmation of the gospel, ye all are partakers
        of my grace.

001:008 For God is my record, how greatly I long after you all in the
        bowels of Jesus Christ.

001:009 And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more
        in knowledge and in all judgment;

001:010 That ye may approve things that are excellent; that ye may be
        sincere and without offence till the day of Christ.

001:011 Being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are by
        Jesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of God.

001:012 But I would ye should understand, brethren, that the things
        which happened unto me have fallen out rather unto the
        furtherance of the gospel;

001:013 So that my bonds in Christ are manifest in all the palace, and
        in all other places;

001:014 And many of the brethren in the Lord, waxing confident by my
        bonds, are much more bold to speak the word without fear.

001:015 Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife; and some
        also of good will:

001:016 The one preach Christ of contention, not sincerely, supposing
        to add affliction to my bonds:

001:017 But the other of love, knowing that I am set for the defence
        of the gospel.

001:018 What then? notwithstanding, every way, whether in pretence, or
        in truth, Christ is preached; and I therein do rejoice, yea,
        and will rejoice.

001:019 For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your
        prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,

001:020 According to my earnest expectation and my hope, that in
        nothing I shall be ashamed, but that with all boldness, as
        always, so now also Christ shall be magnified in my body,
        whether it be by life, or by death.

001:021 For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.

001:022 But if I live in the flesh, this is the fruit of my labour:
        yet what I shall choose I wot not.

001:023 For I am in a strait betwixt two, having a desire to depart,
        and to be with Christ; which is far better:

001:024 Nevertheless to abide in the flesh is more needful for you.

001:025 And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide and
        continue with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith;

001:026 That your rejoicing may be more abundant in Jesus Christ for
        me by my coming to you again.

001:027 Only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of
        Christ: that whether I come and see you, or else be absent, I
        may hear of your affairs, that ye stand fast in one spirit,
        with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel;

001:028 And in nothing terrified by your adversaries: which is to them
        an evident token of perdition, but to you of salvation, and
        that of God.

001:029 For unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to
        believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake;

001:030 Having the same conflict which ye saw in me, and now hear to
        be in me.

002:001 If there be therefore any consolation in Christ, if any
        comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any
        bowels and mercies,

002:002 Fulfil ye my joy, that ye be likeminded, having the same love,
        being of one accord, of one mind.

002:003 Let nothing be done through strife or vainglory; but in
        lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than
        themselves.

002:004 Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on
        the things of others.

002:005 Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus:

002:006 Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be
        equal with God:

002:007 But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form
        of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men:

002:008 And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and
        became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.

002:009 Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a
        name which is above every name:

002:010 That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in
        heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth;

002:011 And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is
        Lord, to the glory of God the Father.

002:012 Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my
        presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your
        own salvation with fear and trembling.

002:013 For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of
        his good pleasure.

002:014 Do all things without murmurings and disputings:

002:015 That ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God,
        without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation,
        among whom ye shine as lights in the world;

002:016 Holding forth the word of life; that I may rejoice in the day
        of Christ, that I have not run in vain, neither laboured in
        vain.

002:017 Yea, and if I be offered upon the sacrifice and service of
        your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all.

002:018 For the same cause also do ye joy, and rejoice with me.

002:019 But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timotheus shortly unto
        you, that I also may be of good comfort, when I know your
        state.

002:020 For I have no man likeminded, who will naturally care for your
        state.

002:021 For all seek their own, not the things which are Jesus
        Christ's.

002:022 But ye know the proof of him, that, as a son with the father,
        he hath served with me in the gospel.

002:023 Him therefore I hope to send presently, so soon as I shall see
        how it will go with me.

002:024 But I trust in the Lord that I also myself shall come shortly.

002:025 Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my
        brother, and companion in labour, and fellowsoldier, but your
        messenger, and he that ministered to my wants.

002:026 For he longed after you all, and was full of heaviness,
        because that ye had heard that he had been sick.

002:027 For indeed he was sick nigh unto death: but God had mercy on
        him; and not on him only, but on me also, lest I should have
        sorrow upon sorrow.

002:028 I sent him therefore the more carefully, that, when ye see him
        again, ye may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful.

002:029 Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness; and hold
        such in reputation:

002:030 Because for the work of Christ he was nigh unto death, not
        regarding his life, to supply your lack of service toward me.

003:001 Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same
        things to you, to me indeed is not grievous, but for you it is
        safe.

003:002 Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the
        concision.

003:003 For we are the circumcision, which worship God in the spirit,
        and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the
        flesh.

003:004 Though I might also have confidence in the flesh. If any other
        man thinketh that he hath whereof he might trust in the flesh,
        I more:

003:005 Circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of the
        tribe of Benjamin, an Hebrew of the Hebrews; as touching the
        law, a Pharisee;

003:006 Concerning zeal, persecuting the church; touching the
        righteousness which is in the law, blameless.

003:007 But what things were gain to me, those I counted loss for
        Christ.

003:008 Yea doubtless, and I count all things but loss for the
        excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom
        I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but
        dung, that I may win Christ,

003:009 And be found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which
        is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ,
        the righteousness which is of God by faith:

003:010 That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and
        the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto
        his death;

003:011 If by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the
        dead.

003:012 Not as though I had already attained, either were already
        perfect: but I follow after, if that I may apprehend that for
        which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus.

003:013 Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended: but this one
        thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and
        reaching forth unto those things which are before,

003:014 I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of
        God in Christ Jesus.

003:015 Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded: and
        if in any thing ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even
        this unto you.

003:016 Nevertheless, whereto we have already attained, let us walk by
        the same rule, let us mind the same thing.

003:017 Brethren, be followers together of me, and mark them which
        walk so as ye have us for an ensample.

003:018 (For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell
        you even weeping, that they are the enemies of the cross of
        Christ:

003:019 Whose end is destruction, whose God is their belly, and whose
        glory is in their shame, who mind earthly things.)

003:020 For our conversation is in heaven; from whence also we look
        for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ:

003:021 Who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like
        unto his glorious body, according to the working whereby he is
        able even to subdue all things unto himself.

004:001 Therefore, my brethren dearly beloved and longed for, my joy
        and crown, so stand fast in the Lord, my dearly beloved.

004:002 I beseech Euodias, and beseech Syntyche, that they be of the
        same mind in the Lord.

004:003 And I intreat thee also, true yokefellow, help those women
        which laboured with me in the gospel, with Clement also, and
        with other my fellowlabourers, whose names are in the book of
        life.

004:004 Rejoice in the Lord alway: and again I say, Rejoice.

004:005 Let your moderation be known unto all men. The Lord is at
        hand.

004:006 Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and
        supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known
        unto God.

004:007 And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall
        keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.

004:008 Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever
        things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever
        things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever
        things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if
        there be any praise, think on these things.

004:009 Those things, which ye have both learned, and received, and
        heard, and seen in me, do: and the God of peace shall be with
        you.

004:010 But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at the last your
        care of me hath flourished again; wherein ye were also
        careful, but ye lacked opportunity.

004:011 Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in
        whatsoever state I am, therewith to be content.

004:012 I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound: every
        where and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to
        be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need.

004:013 I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.

004:014 Notwithstanding ye have well done, that ye did communicate
        with my affliction.

004:015 Now ye Philippians know also, that in the beginning of the
        gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church communicated
        with me as concerning giving and receiving, but ye only.

004:016 For even in Thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my
        necessity.

004:017 Not because I desire a gift: but I desire fruit that may
        abound to your account.

004:018 But I have all, and abound: I am full, having received of
        Epaphroditus the things which were sent from you, an odour of
        a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, wellpleasing to God.

004:019 But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches
        in glory by Christ Jesus.

004:020 Now unto God and our Father be glory for ever and ever. Amen.

004:021 Salute every saint in Christ Jesus. The brethren which are
        with me greet you.

004:022 All the saints salute you, chiefly they that are of Caesar's
        household.

004:023 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.

Book 51	Colossians

001:001 Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and
        Timotheus our brother,

001:002 To the saints and faithful brethren in Christ which are at
        Colosse: Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father and
        the Lord Jesus Christ.

001:003 We give thanks to God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
        praying always for you,

001:004 Since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love
        which ye have to all the saints,

001:005 For the hope which is laid up for you in heaven, whereof ye
        heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel;

001:006 Which is come unto you, as it is in all the world; and
        bringeth forth fruit, as it doth also in you, since the day ye
        heard of it, and knew the grace of God in truth:

001:007 As ye also learned of Epaphras our dear fellowservant, who is
        for you a faithful minister of Christ;

001:008 Who also declared unto us your love in the Spirit.

001:009 For this cause we also, since the day we heard it, do not
        cease to pray for you, and to desire that ye might be filled
        with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual
        understanding;

001:010 That ye might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being
        fruitful in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge
        of God;

001:011 Strengthened with all might, according to his glorious power,
        unto all patience and longsuffering with joyfulness;

001:012 Giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be
        partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light:

001:013 Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath
        translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son:

001:014 In whom we have redemption through his blood, even the
        forgiveness of sins:

001:015 Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every
        creature:

001:016 For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and
        that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be
        thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all
        things were created by him, and for him:

001:017 And he is before all things, and by him all things consist.

001:018 And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the
        beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he
        might have the preeminence.

001:019 For it pleased the Father that in him should all fulness
        dwell;

001:020 And, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him
        to reconcile all things unto himself; by him, I say, whether
        they be things in earth, or things in heaven.

001:021 And you, that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind
        by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled

001:022 In the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy
        and unblameable and unreproveable in his sight:

001:023 If ye continue in the faith grounded and settled, and be not
        moved away from the hope of the gospel, which ye have heard,
        and which was preached to every creature which is under
        heaven; whereof I Paul am made a minister;

001:024 Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up that
        which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for
        his body's sake, which is the church:

001:025 Whereof I am made a minister, according to the dispensation of
        God which is given to me for you, to fulfil the word of God;

001:026 Even the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from
        generations, but now is made manifest to his saints:

001:027 To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory
        of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you,
        the hope of glory:

001:028 Whom we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in
        all wisdom; that we may present every man perfect in Christ
        Jesus:

001:029 Whereunto I also labour, striving according to his working,
        which worketh in me mightily.

002:001 For I would that ye knew what great conflict I have for you,
        and for them at Laodicea, and for as many as have not seen my
        face in the flesh;

002:002 That their hearts might be comforted, being knit together in
        love, and unto all riches of the full assurance of
        understanding, to the acknowledgement of the mystery of God,
        and of the Father, and of Christ;

002:003 In whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.

002:004 And this I say, lest any man should beguile you with enticing
        words.

002:005 For though I be absent in the flesh, yet am I with you in the
        spirit, joying and beholding your order, and the stedfastness
        of your faith in Christ.

002:006 As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk
        ye in him:

002:007 Rooted and built up in him, and stablished in the faith, as ye
        have been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving.

002:008 Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain
        deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the
        world, and not after Christ.

002:009 For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily.

002:010 And ye are complete in him, which is the head of all
        principality and power:

002:011 In whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made
        without hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the
        flesh by the circumcision of Christ:

002:012 Buried with him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with him
        through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him
        from the dead.

002:013 And you, being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of
        your flesh, hath he quickened together with him, having
        forgiven you all trespasses;

002:014 Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against
        us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way,
        nailing it to his cross;

002:015 And having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a shew
        of them openly, triumphing over them in it.

002:016 Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in
        respect of an holyday, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath
        days:

002:017 Which are a shadow of things to come; but the body is of
        Christ.

002:018 Let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility
        and worshipping of angels, intruding into those things which
        he hath not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind,

002:019 And not holding the Head, from which all the body by joints
        and bands having nourishment ministered, and knit together,
        increaseth with the increase of God.

002:020 Wherefore if ye be dead with Christ from the rudiments of the
        world, why, as though living in the world, are ye subject to
        ordinances,

002:021 (Touch not; taste not; handle not;

002:022 Which all are to perish with the using;) after the
        commandments and doctrines of men?

002:023 Which things have indeed a shew of wisdom in will worship, and
        humility, and neglecting of the body: not in any honour to the
        satisfying of the flesh.

003:001 If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are
        above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God.

003:002 Set your affection on things above, not on things on the
        earth.

003:003 For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.

003:004 When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also
        appear with him in glory.

003:005 Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth;
        fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil
        concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry:

003:006 For which things' sake the wrath of God cometh on the children
        of disobedience:

003:007 In the which ye also walked some time, when ye lived in them.

003:008 But now ye also put off all these; anger, wrath, malice,
        blasphemy, filthy communication out of your mouth.

003:009 Lie not one to another, seeing that ye have put off the old
        man with his deeds;

003:010 And have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge
        after the image of him that created him:

003:011 Where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor
        uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free: but Christ
        is all, and in all.

003:012 Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved,
        bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness,
        longsuffering;

003:013 Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man
        have a quarrel against any: even as Christ forgave you, so
        also do ye.

003:014 And above all these things put on charity, which is the bond
        of perfectness.

003:015 And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to the which
        also ye are called in one body; and be ye thankful.

003:016 Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom;
        teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and
        spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the
        Lord.

003:017 And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of
        the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him.

003:018 Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as it is fit
        in the Lord.

003:019 Husbands, love your wives, and be not bitter against them.

003:020 Children, obey your parents in all things: for this is well
        pleasing unto the Lord.

003:021 Fathers, provoke not your children to anger, lest they be
        discouraged.

003:022 Servants, obey in all things your masters according to the
        flesh; not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but in singleness
        of heart, fearing God;

003:023 And whatsoever ye do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not
        unto men;

003:024 Knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of the
        inheritance: for ye serve the Lord Christ.

003:025 But he that doeth wrong shall receive for the wrong which he
        hath done: and there is no respect of persons.

004:001 Masters, give unto your servants that which is just and equal;
        knowing that ye also have a Master in heaven.

004:002 Continue in prayer, and watch in the same with thanksgiving;

004:003 Withal praying also for us, that God would open unto us a door
        of utterance, to speak the mystery of Christ, for which I am
        also in bonds:

004:004 That I may make it manifest, as I ought to speak.

004:005 Walk in wisdom toward them that are without, redeeming the
        time.

004:006 Let your speech be alway with grace, seasoned with salt, that
        ye may know how ye ought to answer every man.

004:007 All my state shall Tychicus declare unto you, who is a beloved
        brother, and a faithful minister and fellowservant in the
        Lord:

004:008 Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that he might
        know your estate, and comfort your hearts;

004:009 With Onesimus, a faithful and beloved brother, who is one of
        you. They shall make known unto you all things which are done
        here.

004:010 Aristarchus my fellowprisoner saluteth you, and Marcus,
        sister's son to Barnabas, (touching whom ye received
        commandments: if he come unto you, receive him;)

004:011 And Jesus, which is called Justus, who are of the
        circumcision. These only are my fellowworkers unto the kingdom
        of God, which have been a comfort unto me.

004:012 Epaphras, who is one of you, a servant of Christ, saluteth
        you, always labouring fervently for you in prayers, that ye
        may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God.

004:013 For I bear him record, that he hath a great zeal for you, and
        them that are in Laodicea, and them in Hierapolis.

004:014 Luke, the beloved physician, and Demas, greet you.

004:015 Salute the brethren which are in Laodicea, and Nymphas, and
        the church which is in his house.

004:016 And when this epistle is read among you, cause that it be read
        also in the church of the Laodiceans; and that ye likewise
        read the epistle from Laodicea.

004:017 And say to Archippus, Take heed to the ministry which thou
        hast received in the Lord, that thou fulfil it.

004:018 The salutation by the hand of me Paul. Remember my bonds.
        Grace be with you. Amen.

Book 52	1 Thessalonians

001:001 Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, unto the church of the
        Thessalonians which is in God the Father and in the Lord Jesus
        Christ: Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and
        the Lord Jesus Christ.

001:002 We give thanks to God always for you all, making mention of
        you in our prayers;

001:003 Remembering without ceasing your work of faith, and labour of
        love, and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, in the
        sight of God and our Father;

001:004 Knowing, brethren beloved, your election of God.

001:005 For our gospel came not unto you in word only, but also in
        power, and in the Holy Ghost, and in much assurance; as ye
        know what manner of men we were among you for your sake.

001:006 And ye became followers of us, and of the Lord, having
        received the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy
        Ghost.

001:007 So that ye were ensamples to all that believe in Macedonia and
        Achaia.

001:008 For from you sounded out the word of the Lord not only in
        Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your faith to
        God-ward is spread abroad; so that we need not to speak any
        thing.

001:009 For they themselves shew of us what manner of entering in we
        had unto you, and how ye turned to God from idols to serve the
        living and true God;

001:010 And to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the
        dead, even Jesus, which delivered us from the wrath to come.

002:001 For yourselves, brethren, know our entrance in unto you, that
        it was not in vain:

002:002 But even after that we had suffered before, and were
        shamefully entreated, as ye know, at Philippi, we were bold in
        our God to speak unto you the gospel of God with much
        contention.

002:003 For our exhortation was not of deceit, nor of uncleanness, nor
        in guile:

002:004 But as we were allowed of God to be put in trust with the
        gospel, even so we speak; not as pleasing men, but God, which
        trieth our hearts.

002:005 For neither at any time used we flattering words, as ye know,
        nor a cloke of covetousness; God is witness:

002:006 Nor of men sought we glory, neither of you, nor yet of others,
        when we might have been burdensome, as the apostles of Christ.

002:007 But we were gentle among you, even as a nurse cherisheth her
        children:

002:008 So being affectionately desirous of you, we were willing to
        have imparted unto you, not the gospel of God only, but also
        our own souls, because ye were dear unto us.

002:009 For ye remember, brethren, our labour and travail: for
        labouring night and day, because we would not be chargeable
        unto any of you, we preached unto you the gospel of God.

002:010 Ye are witnesses, and God also, how holily and justly and
        unblameably we behaved ourselves among you that believe:

002:011 As ye know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every one
        of you, as a father doth his children,

002:012 That ye would walk worthy of God, who hath called you unto his
        kingdom and glory.

002:013 For this cause also thank we God without ceasing, because,
        when ye received the word of God which ye heard of us, ye
        received it not as the word of men, but as it is in truth, the
        word of God, which effectually worketh also in you that
        believe.

002:014 For ye, brethren, became followers of the churches of God
        which in Judaea are in Christ Jesus: for ye also have suffered
        like things of your own countrymen, even as they have of the
        Jews:

002:015 Who both killed the Lord Jesus, and their own prophets, and
        have persecuted us; and they please not God, and are contrary
        to all men:

002:016 Forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they might be
        saved, to fill up their sins alway: for the wrath is come upon
        them to the uttermost.

002:017 But we, brethren, being taken from you for a short time in
        presence, not in heart, endeavoured the more abundantly to see
        your face with great desire.

002:018 Wherefore we would have come unto you, even I Paul, once and
        again; but Satan hindered us.

002:019 For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? Are not
        even ye in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his
        coming?

002:020 For ye are our glory and joy.

003:001 Wherefore when we could no longer forbear, we thought it good
        to be left at Athens alone;

003:002 And sent Timotheus, our brother, and minister of God, and our
        fellowlabourer in the gospel of Christ, to establish you, and
        to comfort you concerning your faith:

003:003 That no man should be moved by these afflictions: for
        yourselves know that we are appointed thereunto.

003:004 For verily, when we were with you, we told you before that we
        should suffer tribulation; even as it came to pass, and ye
        know.

003:005 For this cause, when I could no longer forbear, I sent to know
        your faith, lest by some means the tempter have tempted you,
        and our labour be in vain.

003:006 But now when Timotheus came from you unto us, and brought us
        good tidings of your faith and charity, and that ye have good
        remembrance of us always, desiring greatly to see us, as we
        also to see you:

003:007 Therefore, brethren, we were comforted over you in all our
        affliction and distress by your faith:

003:008 For now we live, if ye stand fast in the Lord.

003:009 For what thanks can we render to God again for you, for all
        the joy wherewith we joy for your sakes before our God;

003:010 Night and day praying exceedingly that we might see your face,
        and might perfect that which is lacking in your faith?

003:011 Now God himself and our Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ,
        direct our way unto you.

003:012 And the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one
        toward another, and toward all men, even as we do toward you:

003:013 To the end he may stablish your hearts unblameable in holiness
        before God, even our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus
        Christ with all his saints.

004:001 Furthermore then we beseech you, brethren, and exhort you by
        the Lord Jesus, that as ye have received of us how ye ought to
        walk and to please God, so ye would abound more and more.

004:002 For ye know what commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus.

004:003 For this is the will of God, even your sanctification, that ye
        should abstain from fornication:

004:004 That every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in
        sanctification and honour;

004:005 Not in the lust of concupiscence, even as the Gentiles which
        know not God:

004:006 That no man go beyond and defraud his brother in any matter:
        because that the Lord is the avenger of all such, as we also
        have forewarned you and testified.

004:007 For God hath not called us unto uncleanness, but unto
        holiness.

004:008 He therefore that despiseth, despiseth not man, but God, who
        hath also given unto us his holy Spirit.

004:009 But as touching brotherly love ye need not that I write unto
        you: for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another.

004:010 And indeed ye do it toward all the brethren which are in all
        Macedonia: but we beseech you, brethren, that ye increase more
        and more;

004:011 And that ye study to be quiet, and to do your own business,
        and to work with your own hands, as we commanded you;

004:012 That ye may walk honestly toward them that are without, and
        that ye may have lack of nothing.

004:013 But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning
        them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others
        which have no hope.

004:014 For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them
        also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.

004:015 For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we
        which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall
        not prevent them which are asleep.

004:016 For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout,
        with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God:
        and the dead in Christ shall rise first:

004:017 Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together
        with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so
        shall we ever be with the Lord.

004:018 Wherefore comfort one another with these words.

005:001 But of the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need
        that I write unto you.

005:002 For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so
        cometh as a thief in the night.

005:003 For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden
        destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with
        child; and they shall not escape.

005:004 But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should
        overtake you as a thief.

005:005 Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day:
        we are not of the night, nor of darkness.

005:006 Therefore let us not sleep, as do others; but let us watch and
        be sober.

005:007 For they that sleep sleep in the night; and they that be
        drunken are drunken in the night.

005:008 But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the
        breastplate of faith and love; and for an helmet, the hope of
        salvation.

005:009 For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain
        salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ,

005:010 Who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should
        live together with him.

005:011 Wherefore comfort yourselves together, and edify one another,
        even as also ye do.

005:012 And we beseech you, brethren, to know them which labour among
        you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you;

005:013 And to esteem them very highly in love for their work's sake.
        And be at peace among yourselves.

005:014 Now we exhort you, brethren, warn them that are unruly,
        comfort the feebleminded, support the weak, be patient toward
        all men.

005:015 See that none render evil for evil unto any man; but ever
        follow that which is good, both among yourselves, and to all
        men.

005:016 Rejoice evermore.

005:017 Pray without ceasing.

005:018 In every thing give thanks: for this is the will of God in
        Christ Jesus concerning you.

005:019 Quench not the Spirit.

005:020 Despise not prophesyings.

005:021 Prove all things; hold fast that which is good.

005:022 Abstain from all appearance of evil.

005:023 And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God
        your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless
        unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.

005:024 Faithful is he that calleth you, who also will do it.

005:025 Brethren, pray for us.

005:026 Greet all the brethren with an holy kiss.

005:027 I charge you by the Lord that this epistle be read unto all
        the holy brethren.

005:028 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.

Book 53	2 Thessalonians

001:001 Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, unto the church of the
        Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:

001:002 Grace unto you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord
        Jesus Christ.

001:003 We are bound to thank God always for you, brethren, as it is
        meet, because that your faith groweth exceedingly, and the
        charity of every one of you all toward each other aboundeth;

001:004 So that we ourselves glory in you in the churches of God for
        your patience and faith in all your persecutions and
        tribulations that ye endure:

001:005 Which is a manifest token of the righteous judgment of God,
        that ye may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which
        ye also suffer:

001:006 Seeing it is a righteous thing with God to recompense
        tribulation to them that trouble you;

001:007 And to you who are troubled rest with us, when the Lord Jesus
        shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels,

001:008 In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God,
        and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ:

001:009 Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the
        presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power;

001:010 When he shall come to be glorified in his saints, and to be
        admired in all them that believe (because our testimony among
        you was believed) in that day.

001:011 Wherefore also we pray always for you, that our God would
        count you worthy of this calling, and fulfil all the good
        pleasure of his goodness, and the work of faith with power:

001:012 That the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in
        you, and ye in him, according to the grace of our God and the
        Lord Jesus Christ.

002:001 Now we beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus
        Christ, and by our gathering together unto him,

002:002 That ye be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by
        spirit, nor by word, nor by letter as from us, as that the day
        of Christ is at hand.

002:003 Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not
        come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of
        sin be revealed, the son of perdition;

002:004 Who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called
        God, or that is worshipped; so that he as God sitteth in the
        temple of God, shewing himself that he is God.

002:005 Remember ye not, that, when I was yet with you, I told you
        these things?

002:006 And now ye know what withholdeth that he might be revealed in
        his time.

002:007 For the mystery of iniquity doth already work: only he who now
        letteth will let, until he be taken out of the way.

002:008 And then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall
        consume with the spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with
        the brightness of his coming:

002:009 Even him, whose coming is after the working of Satan with all
        power and signs and lying wonders,

002:010 And with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that
        perish; because they received not the love of the truth, that
        they might be saved.

002:011 And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that
        they should believe a lie:

002:012 That they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but
        had pleasure in unrighteousness.

002:013 But we are bound to give thanks alway to God for you, brethren
        beloved of the Lord, because God hath from the beginning
        chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit
        and belief of the truth:

002:014 Whereunto he called you by our gospel, to the obtaining of the
        glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.

002:015 Therefore, brethren, stand fast, and hold the traditions which
        ye have been taught, whether by word, or our epistle.

002:016 Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God, even our Father,
        which hath loved us, and hath given us everlasting consolation
        and good hope through grace,

002:017 Comfort your hearts, and stablish you in every good word and
        work.

003:001 Finally, brethren, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may
        have free course, and be glorified, even as it is with you:

003:002 And that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men:
        for all men have not faith.

003:003 But the Lord is faithful, who shall stablish you, and keep you
        from evil.

003:004 And we have confidence in the Lord touching you, that ye both
        do and will do the things which we command you.

003:005 And the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God, and into
        the patient waiting for Christ.

003:006 Now we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus
        Christ, that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that
        walketh disorderly, and not after the tradition which he
        received of us.

003:007 For yourselves know how ye ought to follow us: for we behaved
        not ourselves disorderly among you;

003:008 Neither did we eat any man's bread for nought; but wrought
        with labour and travail night and day, that we might not be
        chargeable to any of you:

003:009 Not because we have not power, but to make ourselves an
        ensample unto you to follow us.

003:010 For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if
        any would not work, neither should he eat.

003:011 For we hear that there are some which walk among you
        disorderly, working not at all, but are busybodies.

003:012 Now them that are such we command and exhort by our Lord Jesus
        Christ, that with quietness they work, and eat their own
        bread.

003:013 But ye, brethren, be not weary in well doing.

003:014 And if any man obey not our word by this epistle, note that
        man, and have no company with him, that he may be ashamed.

003:015 Yet count him not as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother.

003:016 Now the Lord of peace himself give you peace always by all
        means. The Lord be with you all.

003:017 The salutation of Paul with mine own hand, which is the token
        in every epistle: so I write.

003:018 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.

Book 54	1 Timothy

001:001 Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the commandment of God our
        Saviour, and Lord Jesus Christ, which is our hope;

001:002 Unto Timothy, my own son in the faith: Grace, mercy, and
        peace, from God our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord.

001:003 As I besought thee to abide still at Ephesus, when I went into
        Macedonia, that thou mightest charge some that they teach no
        other doctrine,

001:004 Neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which
        minister questions, rather than godly edifying which is in
        faith: so do.

001:005 Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart,
        and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned:

001:006 From which some having swerved have turned aside unto vain
        jangling;

001:007 Desiring to be teachers of the law; understanding neither what
        they say, nor whereof they affirm.

001:008 But we know that the law is good, if a man use it lawfully;

001:009 Knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man,
        but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for
        sinners, for unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and
        murderers of mothers, for manslayers,

001:010 For whoremongers, for them that defile themselves with
        mankind, for menstealers, for liars, for perjured persons, and
        if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound
        doctrine;

001:011 According to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which was
        committed to my trust.

001:012 And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who hath enabled me, for
        that he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry;

001:013 Who was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious:
        but I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief.

001:014 And the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith
        and love which is in Christ Jesus.

001:015 This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that
        Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am
        chief.

001:016 Howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first
        Jesus Christ might shew forth all longsuffering, for a pattern
        to them which should hereafter believe on him to life
        everlasting.

001:017 Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise
        God, be honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen.

001:018 This charge I commit unto thee, son Timothy, according to the
        prophecies which went before on thee, that thou by them
        mightest war a good warfare;

001:019 Holding faith, and a good conscience; which some having put
        away concerning faith have made shipwreck:

001:020 Of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander; whom I have delivered unto
        Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme.

002:001 I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications,
        prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks, be made for all
        men;

002:002 For kings, and for all that are in authority; that we may lead
        a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty.

002:003 For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our
        Saviour;

002:004 Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the
        knowledge of the truth.

002:005 For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men,
        the man Christ Jesus;

002:006 Who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due
        time.

002:007 Whereunto I am ordained a preacher, and an apostle, (I speak
        the truth in Christ, and lie not;) a teacher of the Gentiles
        in faith and verity.

002:008 I will therefore that men pray every where, lifting up holy
        hands, without wrath and doubting.

002:009 In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest
        apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety; not with broided
        hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array;

002:010 But (which becometh women professing godliness) with good
        works.

002:011 Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection.

002:012 But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over
        the man, but to be in silence.

002:013 For Adam was first formed, then Eve.

002:014 And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in
        the transgression.

002:015 Notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing, if they
        continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety.

003:001 This is a true saying, If a man desire the office of a bishop,
        he desireth a good work.

003:002 A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife,
        vigilant, sober, of good behaviour, given to hospitality, apt
        to teach;

003:003 Not given to wine, no striker, not greedy of filthy lucre; but
        patient, not a brawler, not covetous;

003:004 One that ruleth well his own house, having his children in
        subjection with all gravity;

003:005 (For if a man know not how to rule his own house, how shall he
        take care of the church of God?)

003:006 Not a novice, lest being lifted up with pride he fall into the
        condemnation of the devil.

003:007 Moreover he must have a good report of them which are without;
        lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.

003:008 Likewise must the deacons be grave, not doubletongued, not
        given to much wine, not greedy of filthy lucre;

003:009 Holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience.

003:010 And let these also first be proved; then let them use the
        office of a deacon, being found blameless.

003:011 Even so must their wives be grave, not slanderers, sober,
        faithful in all things.

003:012 Let the deacons be the husbands of one wife, ruling their
        children and their own houses well.

003:013 For they that have used the office of a deacon well purchase
        to themselves a good degree, and great boldness in the faith
        which is in Christ Jesus.

003:014 These things write I unto thee, hoping to come unto thee
        shortly:

003:015 But if I tarry long, that thou mayest know how thou oughtest
        to behave thyself in the house of God, which is the church of
        the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth.

003:016 And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God
        was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of
        angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world,
        received up into glory.

004:001 Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times
        some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing
        spirits, and doctrines of devils;

004:002 Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared
        with a hot iron;

004:003 Forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats,
        which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of
        them which believe and know the truth.

004:004 For every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused,
        if it be received with thanksgiving:

004:005 For it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.

004:006 If thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things, thou
        shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished up in the
        words of faith and of good doctrine, whereunto thou hast
        attained.

004:007 But refuse profane and old wives' fables, and exercise thyself
        rather unto godliness.

004:008 For bodily exercise profiteth little: but godliness is
        profitable unto all things, having promise of the life that
        now is, and of that which is to come.

004:009 This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation.

004:010 For therefore we both labour and suffer reproach, because we
        trust in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men,
        specially of those that believe.

004:011 These things command and teach.

004:012 Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the
        believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in
        faith, in purity.

004:013 Till I come, give attendance to reading, to exhortation, to
        doctrine.

004:014 Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by
        prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery.

004:015 Meditate upon these things; give thyself wholly to them; that
        thy profiting may appear to all.

004:016 Take heed unto thyself, and unto the doctrine; continue in
        them: for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself, and them
        that hear thee.

005:001 Rebuke not an elder, but intreat him as a father; and the
        younger men as brethren;

005:002 The elder women as mothers; the younger as sisters, with all
        purity.

005:003 Honour widows that are widows indeed.

005:004 But if any widow have children or nephews, let them learn
        first to shew piety at home, and to requite their parents: for
        that is good and acceptable before God.

005:005 Now she that is a widow indeed, and desolate, trusteth in God,
        and continueth in supplications and prayers night and day.

005:006 But she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth.

005:007 And these things give in charge, that they may be blameless.

005:008 But if any provide not for his own, and specially for those of
        his own house, he hath denied the faith, and is worse than an
        infidel.

005:009 Let not a widow be taken into the number under threescore
        years old, having been the wife of one man.

005:010 Well reported of for good works; if she have brought up
        children, if she have lodged strangers, if she have washed the
        saints' feet, if she have relieved the afflicted, if she have
        diligently followed every good work.

005:011 But the younger widows refuse: for when they have begun to wax
        wanton against Christ, they will marry;

005:012 Having damnation, because they have cast off their first
        faith.

005:013 And withal they learn to be idle, wandering about from house
        to house; and not only idle, but tattlers also and busybodies,
        speaking things which they ought not.

005:014 I will therefore that the younger women marry, bear children,
        guide the house, give none occasion to the adversary to speak
        reproachfully.

005:015 For some are already turned aside after Satan.

005:016 If any man or woman that believeth have widows, let them
        relieve them, and let not the church be charged; that it may
        relieve them that are widows indeed.

005:017 Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double
        honour, especially they who labour in the word and doctrine.

005:018 For the scripture saith, Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that
        treadeth out the corn. And, The labourer is worthy of his
        reward.

005:019 Against an elder receive not an accusation, but before two or
        three witnesses.

005:020 Them that sin rebuke before all, that others also may fear.

005:021 I charge thee before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the
        elect angels, that thou observe these things without
        preferring one before another, doing nothing by partiality.

005:022 Lay hands suddenly on no man, neither be partaker of other
        men's sins: keep thyself pure.

005:023 Drink no longer water, but use a little wine for thy stomach's
        sake and thine often infirmities.

005:024 Some men's sins are open beforehand, going before to judgment;
        and some men they follow after.

005:025 Likewise also the good works of some are manifest beforehand;
        and they that are otherwise cannot be hid.

006:001 Let as many servants as are under the yoke count their own
        masters worthy of all honour, that the name of God and his
        doctrine be not blasphemed.

006:002 And they that have believing masters, let them not despise
        them, because they are brethren; but rather do them service,
        because they are faithful and beloved, partakers of the
        benefit. These things teach and exhort.

006:003 If any man teach otherwise, and consent not to wholesome
        words, even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the
        doctrine which is according to godliness;

006:004 He is proud, knowing nothing, but doting about questions and
        strifes of words, whereof cometh envy, strife, railings, evil
        surmisings,

006:005 Perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds, and destitute of
        the truth, supposing that gain is godliness: from such
        withdraw thyself.

006:006 But godliness with contentment is great gain.

006:007 For we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we
        can carry nothing out.

006:008 And having food and raiment let us be therewith content.

006:009 But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare,
        and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in
        destruction and perdition.

006:010 For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while
        some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and
        pierced themselves through with many sorrows.

006:011 But thou, O man of God, flee these things; and follow after
        righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness.

006:012 Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life,
        whereunto thou art also called, and hast professed a good
        profession before many witnesses.

006:013 I give thee charge in the sight of God, who quickeneth all
        things, and before Christ Jesus, who before Pontius Pilate
        witnessed a good confession;

006:014 That thou keep this commandment without spot, unrebukable,
        until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ:

006:015 Which in his times he shall shew, who is the blessed and only
        Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords;

006:016 Who only hath immortality, dwelling in the light which no man
        can approach unto; whom no man hath seen, nor can see: to whom
        be honour and power everlasting. Amen.

006:017 Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not
        highminded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living
        God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy;

006:018 That they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to
        distribute, willing to communicate;

006:019 Laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against
        the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life.

006:020 O Timothy, keep that which is committed to thy trust, avoiding
        profane and vain babblings, and oppositions of science falsely
        so called:

006:021 Which some professing have erred concerning the faith. Grace
        be with thee. Amen.

Book 55	2 Timothy

001:001 Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, according
        to the promise of life which is in Christ Jesus,

001:002 To Timothy, my dearly beloved son: Grace, mercy, and peace,
        from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.

001:003 I thank God, whom I serve from my forefathers with pure
        conscience, that without ceasing I have remembrance of thee in
        my prayers night and day;

001:004 Greatly desiring to see thee, being mindful of thy tears, that
        I may be filled with joy;

001:005 When I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in
        thee, which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy
        mother Eunice; and I am persuaded that in thee also.

001:006 Wherefore I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift
        of God, which is in thee by the putting on of my hands.

001:007 For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power,
        and of love, and of a sound mind.

001:008 Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord,
        nor of me his prisoner: but be thou partaker of the
        afflictions of the gospel according to the power of God;

001:009 Who hath saved us, and called us with an holy calling, not
        according to our works, but according to his own purpose and
        grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world
        began,

001:010 But is now made manifest by the appearing of our Saviour Jesus
        Christ, who hath abolished death, and hath brought life and
        immortality to light through the gospel:

001:011 Whereunto I am appointed a preacher, and an apostle, and a
        teacher of the Gentiles.

001:012 For the which cause I also suffer these things: nevertheless I
        am not ashamed: for I know whom I have believed, and am
        persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed
        unto him against that day.

001:013 Hold fast the form of sound words, which thou hast heard of
        me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.

001:014 That good thing which was committed unto thee keep by the Holy
        Ghost which dwelleth in us.

001:015 This thou knowest, that all they which are in Asia be turned
        away from me; of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes.

001:016 The Lord give mercy unto the house of Onesiphorus; for he oft
        refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain:

001:017 But, when he was in Rome, he sought me out very diligently,
        and found me.

001:018 The Lord grant unto him that he may find mercy of the Lord in
        that day: and in how many things he ministered unto me at
        Ephesus, thou knowest very well.

002:001 Thou therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in
        Christ Jesus.

002:002 And the things that thou hast heard of me among many
        witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be
        able to teach others also.

002:003 Thou therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus
        Christ.

002:004 No man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of
        this life; that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a
        soldier.

002:005 And if a man also strive for masteries, yet is he not crowned,
        except he strive lawfully.

002:006 The husbandman that laboureth must be first partaker of the
        fruits.

002:007 Consider what I say; and the Lord give thee understanding in
        all things.

002:008 Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised
        from the dead according to my gospel:

002:009 Wherein I suffer trouble, as an evil doer, even unto bonds;
        but the word of God is not bound.

002:010 Therefore I endure all things for the elect's sakes, that they
        may also obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with
        eternal glory.

002:011 It is a faithful saying: For if we be dead with him, we shall
        also live with him:

002:012 If we suffer, we shall also reign with him: if we deny him, he
        also will deny us:

002:013 If we believe not, yet he abideth faithful: he cannot deny
        himself.

002:014 Of these things put them in remembrance, charging them before
        the Lord that they strive not about words to no profit, but to
        the subverting of the hearers.

002:015 Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that
        needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.

002:016 But shun profane and vain babblings: for they will increase
        unto more ungodliness.

002:017 And their word will eat as doth a canker: of whom is Hymenaeus
        and Philetus;

002:018 Who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the
        resurrection is past already; and overthrow the faith of some.

002:019 Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure, having this
        seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his. And, Let every one
        that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity.

002:020 But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of
        silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honour, and
        some to dishonour.

002:021 If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a
        vessel unto honour, sanctified, and meet for the master's use,
        and prepared unto every good work.

002:022 Flee also youthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith,
        charity, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure
        heart.

002:023 But foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they
        do gender strifes.

002:024 And the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle
        unto all men, apt to teach, patient,

002:025 In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if God
        peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of
        the truth;

002:026 And that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the
        devil, who are taken captive by him at his will.

003:001 This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall
        come.

003:002 For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous,
        boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents,
        unthankful, unholy,

003:003 Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers,
        incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good,

003:004 Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than
        lovers of God;

003:005 Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof:
        from such turn away.

003:006 For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead
        captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers
        lusts,

003:007 Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the
        truth.

003:008 Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also
        resist the truth: men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning
        the faith.

003:009 But they shall proceed no further: for their folly shall be
        manifest unto all men, as their's also was.

003:010 But thou hast fully known my doctrine, manner of life,
        purpose, faith, longsuffering, charity, patience,

003:011 Persecutions, afflictions, which came unto me at Antioch, at
        Iconium, at Lystra; what persecutions I endured: but out of
        them all the Lord delivered me.

003:012 Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer
        persecution.

003:013 But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse,
        deceiving, and being deceived.

003:014 But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and
        hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned them;

003:015 And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures,
        which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith
        which is in Christ Jesus.

003:016 All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is
        profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for
        instruction in righteousness:

003:017 That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto
        all good works.

004:001 I charge thee therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ,
        who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and
        his kingdom;

004:002 Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove,
        rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine.

004:003 For the time will come when they will not endure sound
        doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to
        themselves teachers, having itching ears;

004:004 And they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall
        be turned unto fables.

004:005 But watch thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the work
        of an evangelist, make full proof of thy ministry.

004:006 For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure
        is at hand.

004:007 I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have
        kept the faith:

004:008 Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness,
        which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that
        day: and not to me only, but unto all them also that love his
        appearing.

004:009 Do thy diligence to come shortly unto me:

004:010 For Demas hath forsaken me, having loved this present world,
        and is departed unto Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus
        unto Dalmatia.

004:011 Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with thee: for
        he is profitable to me for the ministry.

004:012 And Tychicus have I sent to Ephesus.

004:013 The cloke that I left at Troas with Carpus, when thou comest,
        bring with thee, and the books, but especially the parchments.

004:014 Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil: the Lord reward
        him according to his works:

004:015 Of whom be thou ware also; for he hath greatly withstood our
        words.

004:016 At my first answer no man stood with me, but all men forsook
        me: I pray God that it may not be laid to their charge.

004:017 Notwithstanding the Lord stood with me, and strengthened me;
        that by me the preaching might be fully known, and that all
        the Gentiles might hear: and I was delivered out of the mouth
        of the lion.

004:018 And the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work, and will
        preserve me unto his heavenly kingdom: to whom be glory for
        ever and ever. Amen.

004:019 Salute Prisca and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus.

004:020 Erastus abode at Corinth: but Trophimus have I left at Miletum
        sick.

004:021 Do thy diligence to come before winter. Eubulus greeteth thee,
        and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and all the brethren.

004:022 The Lord Jesus Christ be with thy spirit. Grace be with you.
        Amen.

Book 56	Titus

001:001 Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ,
        according to the faith of God's elect, and the acknowledging
        of the truth which is after godliness;

001:002 In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised
        before the world began;

001:003 But hath in due times manifested his word through preaching,
        which is committed unto me according to the commandment of God
        our Saviour;

001:004 To Titus, mine own son after the common faith: Grace, mercy,
        and peace, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our
        Saviour.

001:005 For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set
        in order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in
        every city, as I had appointed thee:

001:006 If any be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful
        children not accused of riot or unruly.

001:007 For a bishop must be blameless, as the steward of God; not
        selfwilled, not soon angry, not given to wine, no striker, not
        given to filthy lucre;

001:008 But a lover of hospitality, a lover of good men, sober, just,
        holy, temperate;

001:009 Holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught, that he
        may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince
        the gainsayers.

001:010 For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers,
        specially they of the circumcision:

001:011 Whose mouths must be stopped, who subvert whole houses,
        teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre's sake.

001:012 One of themselves, even a prophet of their own, said, The
        Cretians are alway liars, evil beasts, slow bellies.

001:013 This witness is true. Wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they
        may be sound in the faith;

001:014 Not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men,
        that turn from the truth.

001:015 Unto the pure all things are pure: but unto them that are
        defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure; but even their mind
        and conscience is defiled.

001:016 They profess that they know God; but in works they deny him,
        being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work
        reprobate.

002:001 But speak thou the things which become sound doctrine:

002:002 That the aged men be sober, grave, temperate, sound in faith,
        in charity, in patience.

002:003 The aged women likewise, that they be in behaviour as becometh
        holiness, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teachers
        of good things;

002:004 That they may teach the young women to be sober, to love their
        husbands, to love their children,

002:005 To be discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to
        their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed.

002:006 Young men likewise exhort to be sober minded.

002:007 In all things shewing thyself a pattern of good works: in
        doctrine shewing uncorruptness, gravity, sincerity,

002:008 Sound speech, that cannot be condemned; that he that is of the
        contrary part may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of
        you.

002:009 Exhort servants to be obedient unto their own masters, and to
        please them well in all things; not answering again;

002:010 Not purloining, but shewing all good fidelity; that they may
        adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things.

002:011 For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to
        all men,

002:012 Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we
        should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present
        world;

002:013 Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of
        the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ;

002:014 Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all
        iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous
        of good works.

002:015 These things speak, and exhort, and rebuke with all authority.
        Let no man despise thee.

003:001 Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers,
        to obey magistrates, to be ready to every good work,

003:002 To speak evil of no man, to be no brawlers, but gentle,
        shewing all meekness unto all men.

003:003 For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient,
        deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice
        and envy, hateful, and hating one another.

003:004 But after that the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward
        man appeared,

003:005 Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but
        according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of
        regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost;

003:006 Which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our
        Saviour;

003:007 That being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs
        according to the hope of eternal life.

003:008 This is a faithful saying, and these things I will that thou
        affirm constantly, that they which have believed in God might
        be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and
        profitable unto men.

003:009 But avoid foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions,
        and strivings about the law; for they are unprofitable and
        vain.

003:010 A man that is an heretick after the first and second
        admonition reject;

003:011 Knowing that he that is such is subverted, and sinneth, being
        condemned of himself.

003:012 When I shall send Artemas unto thee, or Tychicus, be diligent
        to come unto me to Nicopolis: for I have determined there to
        winter.

003:013 Bring Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey
        diligently, that nothing be wanting unto them.

003:014 And let our's also learn to maintain good works for necessary
        uses, that they be not unfruitful.

003:015 All that are with me salute thee. Greet them that love us in
        the faith. Grace be with you all. Amen.

Book 57	Philemon

001:001 Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy our brother,
        unto Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellowlabourer,

001:002 And to our beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellowsoldier,
        and to the church in thy house:

001:003 Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord
        Jesus Christ.

001:004 I thank my God, making mention of thee always in my prayers,

001:005 Hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast toward the Lord
        Jesus, and toward all saints;

001:006 That the communication of thy faith may become effectual by
        the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in
        Christ Jesus.

001:007 For we have great joy and consolation in thy love, because the
        bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother.

001:008 Wherefore, though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin
        thee that which is convenient,

001:009 Yet for love's sake I rather beseech thee, being such an one
        as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.

001:010 I beseech thee for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my
        bonds:

001:011 Which in time past was to thee unprofitable, but now
        profitable to thee and to me:

001:012 Whom I have sent again: thou therefore receive him, that is,
        mine own bowels:

001:013 Whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might
        have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel:

001:014 But without thy mind would I do nothing; that thy benefit
        should not be as it were of necessity, but willingly.

001:015 For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that thou
        shouldest receive him for ever;

001:016 Not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved,
        specially to me, but how much more unto thee, both in the
        flesh, and in the Lord?

001:017 If thou count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself.

001:018 If he hath wronged thee, or oweth thee ought, put that on mine
        account;

001:019 I Paul have written it with mine own hand, I will repay it:
        albeit I do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine
        own self besides.

001:020 Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my
        bowels in the Lord.

001:021 Having confidence in thy obedience I wrote unto thee, knowing
        that thou wilt also do more than I say.

001:022 But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I trust that through
        your prayers I shall be given unto you.

001:023 There salute thee Epaphras, my fellowprisoner in Christ Jesus;

001:024 Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellowlabourers.

001:025 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.
