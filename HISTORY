v0.5    Lots of improvements here.  Some new features some just refactoring.
        
        Added Shards to the edit view so now this extension can be extended
        (watch for SnS extension extensions to come soon).
        
        Added support for filters.  The only real one planned is Sass for the
        CSS files but, the way I did it, it's pretty extensible (based on how
        Radiant handles page content filters).  Did I mention that there were
        some SnS extension extensions coming soon...
        
        Changed the way stylesheet and javascript urls were routed and evaluated
        (now its a before_filter hooked into SiteController's show_page method).
        This has the added bonus of allowing the stylesheet and javascript
        directories to be changed during runtime (see next point).
        
        Configurations are now handled differently.  Rather than setting them
        once at load-time, they are changed dynamically via Rake tasks.  The
        only exception is the caching directory -- you really don't want to do
        that one dynamcially -- so it's been pulled out of the config and made a
        constant.
        
        Caching is more better.  No more caching the whole url path -- just the
        file, thank you.  This makes it possible to change the directory name
        on the fly.
            
        Bug fixes:
          * Added a 'url' definition (just "") to the extension to fix an issue
            with a change in Radiant 0.6.7 behavior (I really shoulda done that
            all along).
            
          * Corrected an issue where this extension is included as part of a new
            Radiant install.  The RAKE db:bootstrap task would initialize the
            extension which would then try to write the default settings to a
            not-yet-existing config table.


v0.4.1  Bug fixes:
          * Last-Modified header was not reporting the date using a valid
            HTTP format.  This is now spec'ed and fixed.  (Thanks to Jay Levitt
            for identifying this issue).


v0.4    File Uploading!  You can now upload Javascripts or Stylesheets from the
        corresponding index pages.


v0.3.1  Moved Templates to Haml -- now requires Radiant 0.6.7 (or 0.6.6 and
        install Haml yourself -- untested).

        Added 'link' value to <r:stylesheet> and <r:javascript> tags so now you
        can create an external link like:

            <r:stylesheet name="my_file.css" as="link" />
            
            or
            
            <r:javascript name="my_file.js" as="link" />
            
        Also made the as="inline" option XHTML compliant by replacing the
        commenting (<!-- -->) with a proper CDATA wrapper.
 
        See the documentation in 'available tags' on the page-edit page for more
        (now more readable).


v0.3    Big new features plus code refactoring and a bug fix.  First, the new
        fetures include:
        
          * Added <r:stylesheet> and <r:javascript> tags for use in pages.  This
            lets you inject your stylesheet or javascript code into your Page 
            much like using a snippet or just render the URL to the referenced
            CSS or JS file (see the readme for more on this).
            
          * Added <r:stylesheet> and <r:javascript> tags for use in other
            Stylesheets or Javascripts.  This lets you maintain mulitple files
            yet just serve one master-stylesheet or master-javascript to your
            end users (cut down on server requests)
            
            Along with this, I did a fancy trick with tracking dependencies so
            that the cache knows when to update (add, edit, or remove a file
            referenced by a <r:stylesheet> or <r:javascript> tag and the
            dependant file's effectively_updated_at time changes to reflect it).
            
          * Added file upload button to the index pages.  Now instead of just
            creating new stylesheets or javascripts, you can upload a file into
            Radiant
        
        The bugfix includes the completion of the one addressed in v0.2.1 by
        adding the form helper to the remove.html.erb template.
            
            
v0.2.2  Bug fixes:
          * I added the UserActionObserver behavior and accompanying specs
            to the Stylesheet and Javascript models 


v0.2.1  Bug fixes:
          * I corrected the ActionController::InvalidAuthenticityToken that
            comes from my not using the form helpers in my templates.  I also
            weakly spec-ed it.
        
            NOTE: This was only a partial fix.  I corrected the edit.html.erb
            template but not the remove.html.erb one.  See v0.3 for the 
            completely fixed version.


v0.2    Initial public release.  Complete rebuild of the extension to work with
        Rails 2.0 and Radiant 0.6.6.  Added *lots* of specs and focused on
        making this thing robust.
        
        Basic functionality included:
        
          * Stores stylesheet and javascript files
          
          * Caches them with their own, improved response cache (improved in
            that it handles this file type better)
            
          * Configuration management utility to allow extension users to adjust
            default settings


v0.1    Private release to John and Sean as a proof-of-concept (initially called
        the Files extension).
